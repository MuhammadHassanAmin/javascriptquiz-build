JavaScript?","options":["To make a function run faster","To declare a function that always returns a Promise","To prevent a function from executing","To make a function synchronous"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The \'async\' keyword serves several important purposes: 1) Automatically wraps the function\'s return value in a Promise, 2) Enables the use of \'await\' within the function, 3) Ensures the function always returns a Promise even if it returns a non-Promise value, 4) Maintains consistent asynchronous behavior, 5) Integrates with existing Promise-based code, 6) Makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code."},{"id":534,"code":"async function example() {\\n  const result = await Promise.resolve(42);\\n  return

thrown"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"This code will log \'42\' because: 1) The async function wraps the value in a Promise, 2) await unwraps the Promise value before assigning to result, 3) The second await (outside) unwraps the Promise returned by example(), 4) The final value is the raw number 42, 5) await handles Promise resolution automatically, 6) This demonstrates how await simplifies working with Promise values."},{"id":535,"code":"async function getData() {\\n  throw new Error(\'Failed\');\\n}\\n\\ntry {\\n  await getData();\\n} catch (error) {\\n  console.log(error.message);\\n}","question":"How does error handling work with async/await?","options":["Errors are ignored automatically","Errors must be handled with .catch()","Errors can be caught using try/catch","Errors stop the program immediately"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Async/await error handling uses try/catch blocks: 1) Both synchronous and asynchronous errors can be caught, 2) The try/catch block works with thrown errors and rejected Promises, 3) More intuitive than Promise .catch() chains, 4) Provides better scope for error handling variables, 5) Allows for more granular error handling, 6) Makes error handling code look like traditional synchronous code."},{"id":536,"code":"async function parallel() {\\n  const [result1, result2] = await Promise.all([\\n

runs requests in parallel","It prevents errors","It reduces memory usage"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"This pattern enables parallel execution with async/await: 1) Multiple Promises run concurrently with Promise.all(), 2) Better performance than sequential await statements, 3) Results are collected once all operations complete, 4) Maintains readable code structure, 5) Errors from any Promise will reject the entire operation, 6) Commonly used for independent API calls or data fetching."},{"id":537,"question":"Where can the \'await\' keyword be used?","options":["Only inside try/catch blocks","Anywhere in JavaScript code","Only inside async functions or modules","Only with Promise.all()"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The await keyword can only be used in specific contexts: 1) Inside async functions, 2) At the top level of modules (since ES2022), 3) Not allowed in regular synchronous functions, 4) Not allowed in global scope (except modules), 5) Can be used with any Promise or Promise-like object, 6) Multiple await expressions are allowed within these contexts."},{"id":538,"code":"for (let i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {\\n  const data = await

instead of in parallel","It will skip some URLs","It will run forever"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"This code processes requests sequentially, which may not be optimal: 1) Each iteration waits for the previous request to complete, 2) Total time is the sum of all request times, 3) Could be slower than parallel processing, 4) Better to use Promise.all() with map() for parallel requests, 5) Sequential processing might be desired for rate limiting or dependent operations, 6) Performance impact increases with the number of URLs."},{"id":539,"code":"async function example() {\\n  try {\\n

inside async functions, 2) Top-level await is only allowed in modules, 3) Regular scripts don\'t support top-level await, 4) The code needs to be wrapped in an async function, 5) Alternative is to use

will happen if the promise takes longer than ms milliseconds?","options":["The promise will continue running","The function will return undefined","A timeout error will be thrown","The promise will be canceled"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The function will throw a timeout error because: 1) Promise.race returns the first settled Promise, 2) If timeout occurs first, the rejection is propagated, 3) The original promise continues running but its result is ignored, 4) Useful for preventing operations from hanging, 5) Common pattern for adding timeouts to any Promise-based operation, 6) Note that the original promise is not actually canceled."},{"id":545,"question":"What is the relationship between async/await and Promises?","options":["They are completely different mechanisms","async/await replaces Promises","async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises","Promises are built on async/await"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises: 1) Every async function returns a Promise, 2) await operates on Promises internally, 3) They can be used together seamlessly, 4) async/await makes Promise code more readable, 5) All Promise features are still available with async/await, 6) Understanding Promises is crucial for mastering async/await."},{"id":546,"code":"async function processItems(items) {\\n  const results = [];\\n  for

omitted for some Promises","await works with non-Promises","await always returns a Promise"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"This demonstrates flexible await usage: 1) await is only needed when you need the Promise\'s value, 2) Promises can be created and passed without await, 3) await can be used multiple times in an expression, 4) Non-Promise values are unaffected by await, 5) Unnecessary

If the class exists, it removes it; if it doesn\'t exist, it adds it. This is particularly useful for interactive features like showing/hiding elements or changing states. The method returns a boolean indicating whether the class is now present (true) or not (false).

This is more efficient than adding classes one at a time and clearer than using the className property. The method ignores duplicate classes and invalid class names, making it safe to use with dynamic values."},{"id":375,"code":"element.style.cssText = \'color: red; background: blue; padding: 10px;\';","question":"What\'s the purpose of the style.cssText property?","options":["To set multiple CSS properties at once","To read the computed styles","To access external stylesheets","To modify CSS classes"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The style.cssText property allows you to set multiple CSS properties at once using a single string.

The setProperty method takes the property name (including the -- prefix) and the value. These methods work with both standard CSS properties and custom properties, making them versatile for dynamic style manipulation. This is particularly useful for theming and responsive design implementations."},{"id":379,"code":"element.style.transition = \'all 0.3s ease\';\\nelement.style.transform = \'scale(1.1)\';","question":"How do you add CSS transitions dynamically?","options":["By setting the transition property before changing styles","By using the animate() method","By adding a transition class","By using setInterval"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"To add CSS transitions dynamically, set the transition property before modifying the styles you want to animate. The transition property specifies which properties to animate (or \'all\'), the duration, timing function, and delay. This creates smooth animations when the specified properties change. It\'s important to set the transition first; otherwise, the change might happen instantly."},{"id":380,"question":"What\'s the best way to toggle visibility of an element?","options":["Using display property","Using visibility property","Using opacity property","It depends on the use case"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"The best method depends on the specific use case. Display: none removes the element from layout flow but can\'t be animated. Visibility: hidden keeps the space but makes the element invisible and can be animated. Opacity: 0 allows for smooth transitions and keeps the element interactive. Each approach has its benefits: display for complete removal, visibility for maintaining layout, and opacity for animations."},{"id":381,"code":"const rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();\\nelement.style.width = rect.width + \'px\';\\nelement.style.height = rect.height + \'px\';","question":"How can you get an element\'s computed dimensions?","options":["Using element.offsetWidth/Height","Using element.clientWidth/Height","Using getBoundingClientRect()","All of the above"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"All these methods can be used to get element dimensions, but they serve different purposes. getBoundingClientRect() provides the most comprehensive information including position relative to viewport. offsetWidth/Height includes padding and borders. clientWidth/Height includes padding but not borders.

This is the proper way to set important declarations programmatically, rather than concatenating \'!important\' to the value string. This method ensures proper parsing and handling of the important flag by the browser\'s CSS engine."},{"id":383,"question":"Which property would you use to animate non-geometric properties like colors?","options":["animation","transition","transform","animate"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The transition property is used to animate changes in CSS properties, including non-geometric properties like colors, opacity, and backgrounds. While transform is used for geometric transformations, transition can animate almost any CSS property that has intermediate values. This creates smooth transitions when properties change, improving the user experience of interactive elements."},{"id":384,"code":"document.documentElement.style.setProperty(\'--theme-color\', \'blue\');\\ndocument.body.style.backgroundColor = \'var(--theme-color)\';","question":"Where should CSS custom properties be defined for global scope?","options":["On the :root selector","On the body element","On any parent element","It doesn\'t matter"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"CSS custom properties (variables) should be defined on the :root selector (document.documentElement in JavaScript) for global scope. This makes them accessible throughout the entire document. Variables defined here can be overridden in more specific selectors, following the CSS cascade, making them perfect for theming and maintaining consistent styles across an application."},{"id":385,"question":"What happens to child elements when you set opacity on a parent?","options":["Children inherit the exact opacity value","Children maintain their original opacity","Children\'s effective opacity is multiplied by parent\'s opacity","Children become fully transparent"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"When setting opacity on a parent element, the effective opacity of child elements is multiplied by the parent\'s opacity. This means if a parent has opacity: 0.5 and a child has opacity: 0.5, the child\'s effective opacity will be 0.25. This is different from other CSS properties and can\'t be overridden by the child elements, making it important to consider when designing layered interfaces."},{"id":386,"code":"const styles = window.getComputedStyle(element);\\nconst zIndex = parseInt(styles.zIndex, 10);","question":"Why should you parse computed style values before using them in calculations?","options":["Computed styles always return strings","Values might include units","To handle browser differences","All of the above"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"Computed style values should be parsed because they always return strings, may include units (like \'px\', \'%\', etc.), and browsers might return values in different formats. Using parseInt() or parseFloat() helps convert these strings into numbers for calculations. For properties like z-index, parseInt is sufficient, while for dimensions or positions, parseFloat might be more appropriate to handle decimal values."},{"id":387,"code":"element.style.transform = \'translate(50px, 0) scale(1.5) rotate(45deg)\';","question":"What\'s the advantage of using transform for visual changes?","options":["Better performance through GPU acceleration","More precise control over changes","Easier to animate","All of the above"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"Using transform for visual changes offers multiple advantages: it triggers GPU acceleration for better performance, provides precise control over transformations, and is easier to animate smoothly. Unlike changing properties like top or left, transform doesn\'t trigger layout recalculation (reflow), making it ideal for animations and interactive elements. Additionally, multiple transforms can be combined in a single property."},{"id":388,"code":"element.style.backgroundColor = \'#ff0000\';\\nelement.style.backgroundColor = \'rgb(255, 0, 0)\';\\nelement.style.backgroundColor = \'red\';","question":"Which color format is most appropriate for dynamic color manipulation?","options":["Hexadecimal (#ff0000)","RGB/RGBA","Named colors","HSL/HSLA"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"RGB/RGBA format is often most appropriate for dynamic color manipulation because it\'s easy to parse individual components, interpolate between colors, and adjust opacity independently. While hex codes are common in static CSS, RGB values are more intuitive for programmatic changes. HSL can be even better for certain animations as it separates hue, saturation, and lightness, making it easier to modify specific aspects of a color."}]}')},70594:function(e){"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"id":15,"title":"DOM Selection Methods","description":"Master the Document Object Model (DOM) selection methods with this comprehensive quiz.

This is a powerful CSS pseudo-class that can be used with querySelectorAll() to find specific positional elements in the document. For example, document.querySelectorAll(\'li:first-child\') would select all list items that are the first child of their parent.

The :nth-child(n+3) selects all children from the 3rd position onwards, and :nth-child(-n+5) selects all children up to the 5th position. Combining these selectors targets elements that satisfy both conditions. This is a powerful technique for selecting elements by their position in complex document structures."},{"id":343,"question":"What\'s the difference between childNodes and children properties?","options":["No difference, they\'re synonyms","childNodes includes all node types, children includes only element nodes","childNodes is read-only, children is modifiable","childNodes is for HTML documents, children is for XML documents"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The difference is that childNodes includes all node types (Element nodes, Text nodes, Comment nodes, etc.), while children includes only Element nodes. This distinction is important when working with HTML where whitespace often creates text nodes between elements. If you\'re only interested in the element structure and want to ignore whitespace text nodes, use the children property.

The classList property returns a DOMTokenList representing the element\'s classes, and the contains() method checks if that list contains the specified class. This method is more reliable than string-based checks on the className property because it handles multiple classes correctly and doesn\'t require parsing space-delimited strings. The classList API also provides add(), remove(), and toggle() methods for convenient class manipulation."},{"id":345,"question":"How do you select all elements with a class name that starts with \'nav-\'?","options":["document.querySelectorAll(\'.nav-*\')","document.querySelectorAll(\'[class^=\\"nav-\\"]\')","document.querySelectorAll(\'.startsWith(\\"nav-\\")\')","document.getElementsByClassPrefix(\'nav-\')"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"document.querySelectorAll(\'[class^=\\"nav-\\"]\') selects all elements with a class name that starts with \'nav-\'. The ^ symbol in the attribute selector means \'starts with\'. This is part of CSS\'s attribute selection syntax and works with any attribute, not just class. For partial class name matching, you might also use [class*=\\"nav-\\"] to find classes containing \'nav-\' anywhere in the string, or [class$=\\"-nav\\"] to find classes ending with \'-nav\'."},{"id":346,"question":"Which method returns a static collection rather than a live one?","options":["document.getElementsByTagName()","document.getElementsByClassName()","document.querySelectorAll()","document.getElementsByName()"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"document.querySelectorAll() returns a static NodeList rather than a live collection. This means that changes to the DOM after the call won\'t be reflected in the collection. In contrast, methods like getElementsByTagName(), getElementsByClassName(), and getElementsByName() return live collections (HTMLCollection or NodeList) that automatically update when the document changes. This difference is important when working with dynamic content, as code that assumes a collection will automatically update may behave unexpectedly with static collections."},{"id":347,"question":"Which property can be used to access custom data attributes?","options":["element.customData","element.attributes","element.dataset","element.dataAttributes"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"element.dataset can be used to access custom data attributes (data-* attributes) on an element. This property provides access to all data attributes as a DOMStringMap object, with the attribute names converted from kebab-case to camelCase (removing the \'data-\' prefix). For example, if an element has data-user-id=\\"123\\", you can access it as element.dataset.userId. This provides a cleaner interface than getAttribute(\'data-user-id\') and works bidirectionally - changing dataset values updates the corresponding HTML attributes."},{"id":348,"question":"How do you find the closest ancestor element that matches a specific selector?","options":["element.closest(\'.selector\')","element.findAncestor(\'.selector\')","element.parentElement(\'.selector\')","element.ancestor(\'.selector\')"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"element.closest(\'.selector\') finds the closest ancestor element (including the element itself) that matches the specified selector. This method traverses up the DOM tree from the current element, testing each ancestor until it finds a match or reaches the document root. It\'s especially useful for event delegation scenarios where you need to find a specific parent container from an event target.

It\'s extremely useful for several reasons: 1) Better performance as it reduces the number of event listeners, 2) Automatically handles dynamically added elements, 3) Uses less memory, 4) Simplifies event management.

This is particularly useful when clicking on nested elements within your target (like an icon inside a button) - closest() will find the nearest matching ancestor, while matches() only checks the clicked element itself.

Built-in events like \'click\', \'focus\', and \'blur\' are composed by default, while custom events are not composed unless explicitly set. This boundary behavior is a key aspect of Shadow DOM encapsulation, ensuring that internal events stay internal unless specifically designed to propagate outside.

This is because passive listeners are specifically optimized for performance by telling the browser that preventDefault() won\'t be called, allowing immediate scrolling without waiting for JavaScript execution. stopPropagation() will still work as it doesn\'t affect the browser\'s ability to perform the default action.

Understanding these phases is crucial for proper event handling, especially when using event delegation or managing event propagation with stopPropagation()."},{"id":391,"code":"document.querySelector(\'button\').addEventListener(\'click\', function(event) {\\n  event.stopPropagation();\\n  event.preventDefault();\\n});","question":"What\'s the difference between event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault()?","options":["stopPropagation prevents default behavior, preventDefault stops event bubbling","stopPropagation stops event bubbling, preventDefault prevents default behavior","They do the same thing","stopPropagation cancels the event, preventDefault modifies it"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"stopPropagation() and preventDefault() serve different purposes: stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements in the DOM tree, while preventDefault() prevents the default behavior associated with the event (like form submission or link navigation). They can be used independently or together depending on your needs. stopPropagation() is useful for controlling event flow, while preventDefault() is essential for custom handling of native behaviors."},{"id":392,"question":"Which event property tells you which element triggered the event?","options":["event.target","event.currentTarget","event.srcElement","event.element"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"event.target refers to the element that triggered the event (the element that was actually clicked/interacted with), while event.currentTarget refers to the element that the event handler is attached to. This distinction is crucial in event delegation patterns where you might attach a handler to a parent element but need to know which child element was actually clicked."},{"id":393,"code":"parent.addEventListener(\'click\', function(e) {\\n  if (e.target.matches(\'.button\')) {\\n    // Handle button click\\n  }\\n});","question":"What is event delegation and why is it useful?","options":["A way to manage multiple event listeners","A pattern where you attach a single listener to a parent for handling events on children","A method to prevent event bubbling","A technique for creating custom events"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Event delegation is a pattern where instead of attaching event listeners to individual elements, you attach a single listener to a parent element to handle events on its children (including future children). This is highly efficient for large numbers of similar elements (like list items or buttons) as it reduces memory usage and improves performance. It\'s especially useful for dynamically added elements, as they\'ll automatically work without needing new listeners."},{"id":394,"question":"Which events do NOT bubble up the DOM tree by default?","options":["click and submit","focus and blur","mouseover and mouseout","keyup and keydown"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Focus and blur events do not bubble by default (though their counterparts focusin and focusout do). Other non-bubbling events include load, unload, and scroll (on some browsers). Understanding which events bubble is crucial for event delegation and proper event handling. For non-bubbling events, you must either attach listeners directly to target elements or use their bubbling alternatives when available."},{"id":395,"code":"element.addEventListener(\'click\', () => {}, { once: true, passive: true, capture: false });","question":"What does the \'passive\' option in addEventListener do?","options":["Makes the event handler run asynchronously","Prevents event bubbling","Indicates the listener won\'t call preventDefault()","Makes the event handler run only once"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The passive option, when set to true, indicates to the browser that the event handler will not call preventDefault(). This allows the browser to immediately start processing default actions (like scrolling) without waiting for the event handler to complete, significantly improving performance on touch devices. It\'s particularly important for scroll performance on mobile devices. The once option makes the listener run only once, and capture determines if the handler runs in capture phase."},{"id":396,"code":"const handler = (e) => console.log(e.type);\\nelement.addEventListener(\'click\', handler);\\nelement.removeEventListener(\'click\', handler);","question":"What\'s required to successfully remove an event listener?","options":["Just the event type","The same function reference used to add it","The element reference only","A new function with the same code"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"To remove an event listener, you must provide the same function reference that was used to add it. This means anonymous functions or arrow functions defined inline cannot be removed directly. Store the handler function in a variable if you need to remove it later. Additionally, if you used specific options (like capture: true) when adding the listener, you must specify the same options when removing it."},{"id":397,"question":"Which event should you use to detect when all DOM content is loaded, but before external resources?","options":["window.onload","document.onready","DOMContentLoaded","document.load"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading. This is different from the load event (window.onload), which waits for all resources. DOMContentLoaded is ideal for running JavaScript that needs to interact with DOM elements but doesn\'t depend on external resources."},{"id":398,"code":"const event = new CustomEvent(\'userAction\', {\\n  detail: { userId: 123 },\\n  bubbles: true,\\n  cancelable: true\\n});","question":"How do you create and dispatch custom events?","options":["Using Event() constructor only","Using dispatchEvent() with any object","Using CustomEvent() constructor and dispatchEvent()","Using fireEvent() method"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Custom events are created using the CustomEvent constructor and dispatched using dispatchEvent(). The CustomEvent constructor accepts an event type and an options object where you can specify: detail (for custom data), bubbles (if the event should bubble), and cancelable (if the event can be canceled). This is powerful for creating custom component communication or application-wide event systems."},{"id":399,"question":"What\'s the difference between \'mouseenter\' and \'mouseover\' events?","options":["No difference, they\'re aliases","mouseenter doesn\'t bubble, mouseover does","mouseenter is modern, mouseover is deprecated","mouseenter is for desktop only, mouseover works on all devices"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"mouseenter and mouseover have a key difference in their behavior: mouseenter doesn\'t bubble and only triggers when the mouse enters the target element, while mouseover bubbles and triggers when entering the element or any of its children. Similarly, mouseleave doesn\'t bubble while mouseout does. This makes mouseenter/mouseleave more suitable for tracking mouse movement over a specific element without dealing with its children."},{"id":400,"code":"window.addEventListener(\'resize\', function() {\\n  // Heavy computation\\n}, { passive: true });","question":"What\'s the best practice for handling frequent events like \'resize\' or \'scroll\'?","options":["Use async/await","Add multiple event listeners","Implement throttling or debouncing","Always use passive listeners"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"For frequently firing events like resize or scroll, implementing throttling or debouncing is crucial for performance. Throttling limits the rate at which a function can fire (e.g., once every 100ms), while debouncing ensures the function only runs after the event stops firing for a specified time. This prevents excessive calculations and DOM updates. Additionally, using passive listeners can help with scroll performance, but it\'s not a complete solution for heavy computations."},{"id":401,"code":"document.body.addEventListener(\'click\', function check(e) {\\n  if (e.target.matches(\'.remove-btn\')) {\\n    e.target.removeEventListener(\'click\', check);\\n  }\\n});","question":"What potential issue exists in this code?","options":["The event listener can\'t be removed","The matches method isn\'t supported","The wrong element is targeted","The listener removal won\'t work due to event delegation"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"The code attempts to remove an event listener from a child element (.remove-btn) that doesn\'t actually have the listener - the listener is on document.body using event delegation. When using event delegation, you don\'t need (and can\'t) remove listeners from the target elements because they don\'t have any listeners attached. If you need to stop handling events for specific elements, use a flag or remove the elements themselves."},{"id":402,"question":"Which events should you use for handling keyboard input in forms?","options":["only keypress","only keydown","input and change","keyup and keydown"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The input and change events are best for handling form input. The input event fires whenever the input value changes (immediately), while change fires when the input loses focus and its value has changed. These events work across all input types and handle all forms of input (keyboard, mouse, copy-paste, drag-drop, etc.). Keyboard events (keyup/keydown/keypress) are better for specific keyboard interaction patterns like shortcuts."},{"id":403,"code":"form.addEventListener(\'submit\', async (e) => {\\n  e.preventDefault();\\n  try {\\n    await submitData();\\n  } catch (err) {\\n    e.target.submit();\\n  }\\n});","question":"What\'s wrong with calling e.target.submit() in a submit event handler?","options":["Nothing, it\'s correct usage","It can cause an infinite loop","submit() is not a valid method","It bypasses form validation"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Calling form.submit() or e.target.submit() within a submit event handler can cause an infinite loop because it triggers another submit event, which runs the handler again. To properly handle form submission after async operations, either use a flag to prevent recursion, modify the form\'s action attribute, or use fetch/XMLHttpRequest directly. Additionally, form.submit() bypasses form validation and doesn\'t trigger submit events."},{"id":404,"question":"What\'s the proper way to handle memory leaks with event listeners?","options":["Let garbage collection handle it","Use weak references only","Remove listeners when elements are removed","Use anonymous functions"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"To prevent memory leaks, you should always remove event listeners when they\'re no longer needed, especially when removing elements from the DOM. Even if an element is removed, its event listeners can keep it in memory if not properly cleaned up. Best practices include: removing listeners in cleanup/unmount functions, using event delegation where appropriate, and keeping track of listener references for removal. Some frameworks handle this automatically, but in vanilla JS it\'s your responsibility."},{"id":405,"code":"element.addEventListener(\'touchstart\', handler, { passive: true });\\nelement.addEventListener(\'touchmove\', handler, { passive: true });","question":"Why should touch events be passive by default?","options":["To prevent touch events entirely","To improve scrolling performance","To enable multi-touch","To prevent event bubbling"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Touch events should be passive by default to improve scrolling performance, especially on mobile devices. When a touch event listener is not passive, the browser must wait to see if the handler calls preventDefault() before starting to scroll, causing a delay. Making touch event listeners passive tells the browser it can start scrolling immediately without waiting for JavaScript, significantly improving perceived performance and smoothness."},{"id":406,"code":"parent.addEventListener(\'click\', e => {\\n  const closest = e.target.closest(\'.item\');\\n  if (closest) {\\n    handleItem(closest);\\n  }\\n});","question":"What advantage does closest() have over matches() in event delegation?","options":["It\'s faster","It works with all event types","It finds the nearest matching ancestor including the element itself","It prevents event bubbling"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"closest() is particularly useful in event delegation because it finds the nearest ancestor element (including the element itself) that matches the selector. This is more robust than matches() because it handles cases where you might click on a child element within your target element (like clicking on text or an icon inside a button). matches() only checks the element itself, requiring additional code to handle nested elements."},{"id":407,"question":"What\'s the recommended way to handle events in dynamically loaded content?","options":["Add listeners after content loads","Use event delegation","Use inline event handlers","Reload the page"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Event delegation is the recommended approach for handling events on dynamically loaded content. By attaching the event listener to a stable parent element and using e.target or e.target.closest() to identify relevant child elements, your event handlers will automatically work with newly added content. This eliminates the need to attach new listeners every time content is loaded and provides better performance through fewer event listeners."},{"id":408,"code":"element.addEventListener(\'click\', function(e) {\\n  if (condition) {\\n    return false; // Trying to prevent default\\n  }\\n});","question":"Why doesn\'t returning false prevent default behavior in addEventListener?","options":["The condition is wrong","return false only works with on-event handlers","addEventListener is deprecated","The syntax is incorrect"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Returning false to prevent default behavior only works with on-event handlers (like onclick) and jQuery event handlers. With addEventListener, you must explicitly call event.preventDefault(). This is because addEventListener follows the W3C standard event model, where return values from handlers are ignored. This is a common source of confusion for developers coming from jQuery or older JavaScript practices."}]}')},56768:function(e){"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"title":"DOM & Events","description":"Master JavaScript\'s DOM manipulation and event handling mechanisms.

It provides better type checking, auto-completion in IDEs, and is more maintainable. The style property uses camelCase names (backgroundColor instead of background-color) and provides direct access to individual CSS properties.

They represent one of the most significant syntax additions in this major update to JavaScript, alongside features like classes, let/const declarations, destructuring, promises, and modules. Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions and solve common issues with `this` binding. Before ES6, developers often used function expressions or function declarations with workarounds like `.bind()` or saving `this` to a variable to handle scope issues. Arrow functions quickly became popular after their introduction because they address these pain points while making code more readable, especially for short callback functions and functional programming patterns."},{"id":202,"question":"Which of the following is a valid arrow function syntax?","options":["const add = (a, b) -> { return a + b; }","const add = (a, b) => return a + b;","const add = (a, b) => a + b;","const add = a, b => a + b;"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The valid arrow function syntax is `const add = (a, b) => a + b;`. This demonstrates the concise body syntax where the expression following the arrow (`=>`) is implicitly returned without needing the `return` keyword or curly braces. When an arrow function takes multiple parameters, they must be enclosed in parentheses. For single expressions, the curly braces and `return` statement can be omitted, which is one of the key benefits of arrow functions for short operations. Option 1 uses an incorrect arrow symbol (`->`). Option 2 incorrectly includes the `return` keyword in a concise body (without curly braces). Option 4 is missing the required parentheses around multiple parameters. Note that for a single parameter (e.g., `x => x * 2`), the parentheses are optional, but they\'re required when there are no parameters (`() => result`) or multiple parameters."},{"id":203,"question":"What is the key difference in `this` binding between arrow functions and regular functions?","options":["Arrow functions don\'t have access to `this` at all","Arrow functions define their own `this` value based on where they\'re called","Arrow functions inherit `this` from the enclosing lexical context","Arrow functions always bind `this` to the global object"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Arrow functions inherit `this` from the enclosing lexical context (the surrounding code where the arrow function is defined). Unlike regular functions, which define their own `this` value based on how they\'re called, arrow functions don\'t have their own `this` binding. This lexical binding behavior makes arrow functions particularly useful for callbacks and methods where you want to preserve the `this` value from the surrounding context. For example, in a class method that uses callbacks, an arrow function would maintain the class instance as `this`, while a regular function would have its own `this` value (often the global object or undefined in strict mode). This feature eliminates common issues in JavaScript where developers had to use workarounds like `var self = this` or `.bind(this)` to maintain the correct context in nested functions."},{"id":204,"question":"What will be logged to the console?","code":"const obj = {\\n  name: \'Object\',\\n  regularFunction: function() {\\n    console.log(this.name);\\n  },\\n  arrowFunction: () => {\\n    console.log(this.name);\\n  }\\n};\\n\\nobj.regularFunction();\\nobj.arrowFunction();","options":["\'Object\', \'Object\'","\'Object\', undefined","undefined, \'Object\'","undefined, undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output will be `\'Object\'` followed by `undefined` (or possibly `\'\'` if run in a browser where `window.name` is an empty string). This demonstrates the critical difference in `this` binding between regular and arrow functions. In `regularFunction`, `this` refers to the object that calls the method (`obj`), so `this.name` is `\'Object\'`. However, in `arrowFunction`, `this` is inherited from the enclosing lexical scope where the object literal was defined, which is typically the global scope (or the module scope in modules). In the global scope, `this` usually refers to the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js), where `this.name` might be undefined or an empty string. This behavior shows why arrow functions aren\'t suitable for object methods that need to access the object via `this`—regular functions are generally more appropriate for such cases. The example highlights how important it is to understand the lexical `this` binding behavior when choosing between arrow functions and regular functions."},{"id":205,"question":"Which of the following cannot be done with arrow functions?","options":["Accept multiple parameters","Return object literals directly","Be used as constructors with the \'new\' keyword","Create higher-order functions"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors with the \'new\' keyword. They lack several internal properties that regular functions have, including the internal [[Construct]] method that allows functions to be called with `new`. Attempting to use an arrow function with `new` will result in a TypeError: \\"Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors\\". Additionally, arrow functions don\'t have their own `this` context, don\'t have a `prototype` property, and can\'t be used for `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`. This limitation exists because arrow functions are designed for non-method functions and lexical binding, not for creating objects. For constructors and methods that need to access `this`, regular functions (function expressions, function declarations, or class methods) are more appropriate. The other options are all valid uses of arrow functions: they can accept multiple parameters, return object literals (though they require parentheses: `() => ({ prop: value })`), and can create and return other functions as higher-order functions."},{"id":206,"question":"What is the output of this code?","code":"const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\\nconst doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);\\nconsole.log(doubled);","options":["[1, 2, 3, 4]","[2, 4, 6, 8]","TypeError: numbers.map is not a function","undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output is `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. This code demonstrates a common and elegant use of arrow functions as callbacks. The `map()` method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. Here, the arrow function `num => num * 2` takes each element from the `numbers` array and returns its doubled value. The concise syntax of arrow functions makes them particularly well-suited for this kind of operation, eliminating the boilerplate code of a full function expression. This example shows how arrow functions can make functional programming patterns more readable. The original array remains unchanged, and a new array with the transformed values is created and stored in `doubled`. This pattern is frequently used for transforming data in a clean, declarative way without side effects."},{"id":207,"question":"When returning an object literal directly from an arrow function with a concise body, what syntax must be used?","options":["=> {key: value}","=> return {key: value}","=> ({key: value})","=> {{key: value}}"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"When returning an object literal directly from an arrow function with a concise body, you must wrap the object in parentheses: `=> ({key: value})`. This is necessary because without parentheses, JavaScript interprets the curly braces as the function body delimiters rather than an object literal. The parentheses tell the JavaScript engine to treat the curly braces as an expression (an object literal) rather than as a block of statements. For example, `const getUser = id => ({ id, name: \'User\' + id });` correctly returns an object, while `const getUser = id => { id, name: \'User\' + id };` would be interpreted as a function body with two statements (both of which do nothing) and no return value. This parenthesized syntax is a common source of confusion for developers new to arrow functions but becomes second nature with practice. It\'s only required when directly returning an object literal with the concise (implicit return) syntax."},{"id":208,"question":"What is the value of `output` after this code runs?","code":"const calculate = (a, b) => a + b;\\nconst output = calculate?.(5, 10);","options":["15","undefined","null","TypeError"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The value of `output` will be `15`. This code demonstrates two concepts: arrow functions and optional chaining (`?.`). The arrow function `calculate` takes two parameters and returns their sum. The optional chaining operator (`?.`) is used to call a function that might be null or undefined—if the value before the operator is null or undefined, the expression short-circuits and returns undefined without throwing an error. In this case, `calculate` is a valid function, so it\'s called with arguments 5 and 10, resulting in 15. Optional chaining was introduced in ES2020 and is useful for safely accessing and calling properties or methods that might not exist. This example is somewhat contrived since we can see that `calculate` is defined, but in real-world scenarios, this pattern is valuable when dealing with potentially undefined functions, especially when working with external data or APIs where the structure might be uncertain."},{"id":209,"question":"Which of the following is true about the \'arguments\' object in arrow functions?","options":["Arrow functions have their own \'arguments\' object like regular functions","Arrow functions have an enhanced version of the \'arguments\' object","Arrow functions cannot access the \'arguments\' object at all","Arrow functions don\'t have their own \'arguments\' object but inherit it from the enclosing scope"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"Arrow functions don\'t have their own \'arguments\' object but inherit it from the enclosing scope. This is similar to how they handle the `this` keyword. If an arrow function is defined within a regular function, it can access the `arguments` object of that enclosing function. However, if an arrow function is defined at the top level or in a context where no `arguments` object exists, attempts to access `arguments` will result in a reference to the variable in an outer scope or a ReferenceError if no such variable exists. Instead of using the `arguments` object, the recommended approach in arrow functions is to use rest parameters (`...args`), which provide a true array of arguments with all Array methods available. For example: `const sum = (...numbers) => numbers.reduce((total, n) => total + n, 0);`. This limitation is consistent with the minimalist design of arrow functions, which lack their own bindings for several keywords including `this`, `super`, `arguments`, and `new.target`."},{"id":210,"question":"What is the output of this code?","code":"const outer = function() {\\n  const x = 5;\\n  const inner = () => console.log(x);\\n  return inner;\\n};\\n\\nconst fn = outer();\\nfn();","options":["undefined","5","ReferenceError: x is not defined","TypeError: inner is not a function"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output is `5`. This code demonstrates the creation of a closure using an arrow function. A closure is formed when a function retains access to variables from its lexical scope even after the outer function has finished executing. In this example, `outer` defines a variable `x` with value 5 and returns the arrow function `inner`, which references `x`. When `outer()` is called, it executes and returns `inner`, which is assigned to `fn`. Even though `outer` has completed execution, the returned arrow function (`fn`) still maintains access to the `x` variable through closure. When `fn()` is subsequently called, it can access the `x` variable from its original lexical environment, outputting `5`. This behavior is the same for both arrow functions and regular functions, but arrow functions are often preferred for closures because of their concise syntax and lexical `this` binding. Closures are powerful in JavaScript, enabling patterns like data encapsulation, partial application, and maintaining state between function calls."},{"id":211,"question":"What will this code log to the console?","code":"const counter = {\\n  count: 0,\\n  increment: function() {\\n    setInterval(() => {\\n      console.log(++this.count);\\n    }, 1000);\\n  }\\n};\\n\\ncounter.increment();","options":["NaN, NaN, NaN... (repeatedly)","1, 2, 3... (incrementing each second)","TypeError: Cannot read property \'count\' of undefined","0, 0, 0... (repeatedly)"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"This code will log `1, 2, 3...` incrementing each second. It demonstrates a practical use case for arrow functions—maintaining the correct `this` context in callbacks. In the `increment` method (a regular function), `this` refers to the `counter` object. The arrow function inside `setInterval` inherits this same `this` value because arrow functions don\'t have their own `this` binding. Each second, the callback executes, incrementing and logging the counter\'s `count` property. If a regular function were used instead (`setInterval(function() { console.log(++this.count); }, 1000)`), `this` inside that function would refer to the global object (or be `undefined` in strict mode), not the counter object. This would cause `this.count` to be `NaN` or throw an error. Before arrow functions, developers had to use workarounds like `var self = this` or `.bind(this)` to solve this problem. This example shows why arrow functions are particularly valuable for callbacks, event handlers, and other scenarios where preserving the lexical `this` is important."},{"id":212,"question":"Which of the following statements about arrow functions is FALSE?","options":["Arrow functions can be used for one-line operations without a return statement","Arrow functions inherit the \'this\' value from the surrounding lexical context","Arrow functions can access the \'super\' keyword from their parent scope","Arrow functions can have explicit return statements with curly braces"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The FALSE statement is that arrow functions can access the \'super\' keyword from their parent scope. Although arrow functions do inherit `this`, `arguments`, and `new.target` from their surrounding scope, they cannot access `super` from their parent scope. The `super` keyword works only in classes and object literals with methods, and it doesn\'t get lexically inherited by arrow functions inside them. If you need to use `super` inside a callback or nested function, you would still need to use a regular function expression with a saved reference to `super`. The other statements are all TRUE: Arrow functions can use the concise body syntax for one-liners with an implicit return; they do inherit the `this` value from their enclosing lexical context; and they can use the block body syntax with curly braces and explicit `return` statements for more complex operations. This distinction is important when working with inheritance in object-oriented JavaScript code, particularly with ES6 classes."},{"id":213,"question":"How would you write an arrow function that takes a single parameter and returns its square?","options":["square = x -> x * x;","const square = x => x * x;","const square = (x) => { x * x };","const square = x => return x * x;"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The correct way to write an arrow function that takes a single parameter and returns its square is `const square = x => x * x;`. This demonstrates two key features of arrow function syntax: 1) When there\'s only one parameter, the parentheses around the parameter list are optional; and 2) When the function body consists of a single expression, the curly braces and `return` keyword can be omitted (implicit return). This concise syntax is one of the main advantages of arrow functions for simple operations. Option 1 uses an incorrect arrow symbol (`->`). Option 3 includes curly braces but is missing the required `return` statement when using a block body. Option 4 incorrectly includes the `return` keyword in a concise body without curly braces. The correct function could also be written with parentheses or a block body as: `const square = (x) => x * x;` or `const square = x => { return x * x; }`, but the solution shown is the most concise valid form."},{"id":214,"question":"What is the output of this code?","code":"const numbers = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3];\\nnumbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);\\nconsole.log(numbers);","options":["[4, 2, 5, 1, 3]","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]","[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]","TypeError: Cannot read property \'sort\' of undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. This code demonstrates using an arrow function as a comparator for the `sort()` method. The `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. When a comparator function is provided, it determines the sorting order based on its return value: negative if `a` should come before `b`, positive if `a` should come after `b`, or zero if they\'re equivalent. The arrow function `(a, b) => a - b` provides a concise way to express numeric ascending sort. By subtracting `b` from `a`, it returns a negative value when `a` is less than `b`, ensuring smaller numbers come first. This is a common pattern for numeric sorting in JavaScript, and arrow functions make it more readable than the equivalent function expression. Note that `sort()` modifies the original array in place, so the `numbers` array itself is changed to the sorted order. To sort in descending order, the comparator would be `(a, b) => b - a`."},{"id":215,"question":"What happens if you try to use \'yield\' within an arrow function?","options":["It works normally, allowing arrow functions to be generators","It yields undefined but continues execution","It throws a SyntaxError","It creates a special type of async arrow function"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"If you try to use the \'yield\' keyword within an arrow function, it will throw a SyntaxError. Arrow functions cannot be generator functions. The \'yield\' keyword can only be used within generator functions, which are defined using the function* syntax (e.g., `function* myGenerator() { yield 1; }`). This is one of several features that arrow functions intentionally do not support. Arrow functions are designed to be lightweight and specifically suited for non-method functions, especially those that don\'t need their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` bindings. If you need to create a generator, you must use a regular function declaration or expression with the generator syntax. This limitation is consistent with the focused design of arrow functions, which prioritizes conciseness and lexical binding for common function use cases over supporting all possible function features. Other features arrow functions don\'t support include being constructors, having their own `this` binding, and accessing `arguments`."},{"id":216,"question":"In which scenario would an arrow function NOT be the best choice?","options":["As a callback for setTimeout","As a method in an object literal","As a mapping function for array transformation","As a simple event handler"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"An arrow function would NOT be the best choice as a method in an object literal. Since arrow functions inherit `this` from the enclosing lexical scope (often the global scope when defined in an object literal) rather than being bound to the object, they typically can\'t access the object\'s properties via `this`. For example, in `const obj = { name: \'Object\', getName: () => this.name };`, the `getName` method would not return \'Object\' because `this` refers to the outer scope, not the object itself. Object methods generally need to access the object instance via `this`, making regular functions (or the shorthand method syntax `getName() { return this.name }`) more appropriate. Arrow functions are ideal for the other scenarios mentioned: callbacks for setTimeout/setInterval, mapping/filtering operations on arrays, and event handlers when you need to access `this` from the enclosing scope. Understanding when to use arrow functions versus regular functions is important for writing effective JavaScript code, and object methods are one of the primary cases where arrow functions are typically not suitable."},{"id":217,"question":"What is the output of this code?","code":"const fn = () => arguments;\\nconsole.log(fn(1, 2, 3));","options":["[1, 2, 3]","{ \'0\': 1, \'1\': 2, \'2\': 3, length: 3 }","ReferenceError: arguments is not defined","undefined"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"This code will result in a ReferenceError: arguments is not defined (assuming this is running at the global scope). Arrow functions don\'t have their own `arguments` object, unlike regular functions. Instead, arrow functions inherit the `arguments` object from their enclosing lexical scope. When the arrow function is defined in the global scope, there is no `arguments` object to inherit, resulting in a ReferenceError when trying to access it. If this same arrow function were defined inside a regular function, it would access that function\'s `arguments` object. For example: `function outer() { const fn = () => arguments; return fn(); } console.log(outer(1, 2, 3));` would log the `arguments` object from `outer`. When working with arrow functions, it\'s generally better to use rest parameters instead of `arguments` for better clarity and to avoid these pitfalls: `const fn = (...args) => args;`. This creates a true array containing all arguments, which is easier to work with than the array-like `arguments` object."},{"id":218,"question":"When using an arrow function with a single parameter, which syntax feature is optional?","options":["The arrow (=>)","The parameter name","The parentheses around the parameter","The curly braces for the function body"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"When using an arrow function with a single parameter, the parentheses around the parameter are optional. For example, both `x => x * 2` and `(x) => x * 2` are valid and equivalent. This is a syntactic convenience that makes arrow functions even more concise for the common case of single-parameter functions. However, parentheses are required in all other cases: when there are no parameters (`() => result`), multiple parameters (`(x, y) => x + y`), or default parameters (`(x = 1) => x * 2`). Also, curly braces are optional for the function body only when there\'s a single expression that you want to implicitly return. For multi-statement function bodies, curly braces are required, and an explicit `return` statement is needed to return a value. This flexibility in syntax allows developers to write very concise functions for simple operations while still supporting more complex implementations when needed."},{"id":219,"question":"What is the behavior of `new.target` in arrow functions?","options":["It refers to the function object itself","It refers to the target of the new operator","It\'s inherited from the enclosing function","Arrow functions don\'t support new.target and will throw an error if accessed"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The `new.target` property in arrow functions is inherited from the enclosing function. Arrow functions don\'t have their own `new.target` binding, just as they don\'t have their own `this`, `arguments`, or `super` bindings. If an arrow function is defined within a function that was called with `new`, it inherits the `new.target` value from that enclosing function, which would be a reference to the constructor that was invoked with `new`. If the arrow function is not inside any function that was called with `new`, accessing `new.target` will behave according to the normal rules: it will be `undefined` in regular function calls or reference the appropriate constructor in constructor calls. It\'s also worth noting that since arrow functions cannot be used as constructors (cannot be called with the `new` operator), `new.target` inside an arrow function will never refer to the arrow function itself. This behavior is consistent with how arrow functions handle other function-specific properties by lexically inheriting them."},{"id":220,"question":"What is the output of this code?","code":"const add = (a, b) => a + b;\\nconsole.log(add(2, 3, 4, 5));","options":["14","5","TypeError: too many arguments","undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output is `5`. This demonstrates how JavaScript handles extra arguments passed to a function. When more arguments are provided than parameters defined, the extra arguments are simply ignored. The arrow function `add` is defined with two parameters, `a` and `b`, which receive the values `2` and `3` respectively. The additional arguments `4` and `5` are passed to the function but not assigned to any named parameters, so they have no effect on the function\'s execution. The function calculates `2 + 3` and returns `5`. This behavior is the same for arrow functions, function expressions, and function declarations. If you need to work with a variable number of arguments, you can use rest parameters (`...numbers`) to collect all arguments into an array. For example, `const sum = (...numbers) => numbers.reduce((total, n) => total + n, 0);` would sum all provided arguments.

Callbacks allow you to handle the results of an operation after it completes, rather than blocking execution until it finishes."},{"id":263,"question":"What is a higher-order function in JavaScript?","options":["A function that takes at least one function as an argument or returns a function","A function with high priority in the execution context","A function that uses the \'this\' keyword","A function that can only be called once"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"A higher-order function is a function that takes at least one function as an argument or returns a function as its result. This is a key concept in functional programming. Common examples in JavaScript include map(), filter(), reduce(), and setTimeout(). Higher-order functions enable powerful abstractions and code reuse by allowing function composition and delegation."},{"id":264,"question":"Which of the following is NOT a higher-order function in JavaScript\'s Array prototype?","options":["map()","filter()","reduce()","concat()"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"concat() is not a higher-order function because it doesn\'t take a function as an argument. It simply merges two or more arrays and returns a new array. In contrast, map(), filter(), and reduce() are all higher-order functions as they accept a callback function as their first argument which is executed for each element in the array."},{"id":265,"question":"What happens if you pass an anonymous function as a callback?","code":"setTimeout(function() {\\n  console.log(\'Hello, world!\');\\n}, 1000);","options":["It causes a syntax error","The function executes immediately","The function is executed when the outer function (setTimeout) calls it","Nothing happens because anonymous functions can\'t be callbacks"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"When you pass an anonymous function as a callback, it works exactly the same as a named function. In this example, the anonymous function will be called after the 1000ms timeout completes. Anonymous functions are commonly used as callbacks when the function doesn\'t need to be reused elsewhere in the code. They provide a clean, concise way to define function behavior inline where it\'s needed."},{"id":266,"question":"Which statement about callbacks is true?","options":["Callbacks can only be used in asynchronous code","Callbacks are always executed immediately","Callbacks can be used in both synchronous and asynchronous operations","Callbacks can only be defined as anonymous functions"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Callbacks can be used in both synchronous and asynchronous operations. While callbacks are often associated with asynchronous programming (like handling API responses or timeouts), they\'re also used in synchronous contexts like Array methods (forEach, map, filter, etc.). A callback is simply a function passed to another function to be executed at a later point, whether that\'s immediately (synchronous) or after some delay (asynchronous)."},{"id":267,"question":"What is the output of the following code?","code":"function calculate(x, y, operation) {\\n  return operation(x, y);\\n}\\n\\nconst result = calculate(5, 3, function(a, b) {\\n  return a * b;\\n});\\n\\nconsole.log(result);","options":["8","15","2","undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output is 15. The calculate function is a higher-order function that takes two numbers and an operation function as arguments. It then applies the operation to the numbers and returns the result. In this case, we\'re passing an anonymous function that multiplies its two arguments. So calculate(5, 3, multiply) computes 5 * 3, which equals 15. This is a classic example of a higher-order function that abstracts the operation to be performed."},{"id":268,"question":"What is the output of this Array.map() example?","code":"const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\\nconst doubled = numbers.map(function(num) {\\n  return num * 2;\\n});\\nconsole.log(doubled);","options":["[1, 2, 3, 4]","[2, 4, 6, 8]","[1, 4, 9, 16]","undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output is [2, 4, 6, 8]. The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this example, each number in the original array is multiplied by 2. map() is a higher-order function because it takes a callback function as an argument. This callback is executed for each element in the array, transforming the array without mutating the original."},{"id":269,"question":"What is the main purpose of the Array.reduce() method?","options":["To filter out elements from an array","To execute a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value","To modify each element of an array in place","To check if at least one element in an array passes a given test"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The Array.reduce() method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. The reducer function takes four arguments: accumulator, current value, current index, and the source array. reduce() is particularly powerful for transforming an array into any other type of value (like an object, number, or string). It\'s commonly used for summing numbers, concatenating strings, or building composite data structures from array data."},{"id":270,"question":"Which of the following best describes the callback hell problem?","options":["When a higher-order function doesn\'t properly call its callback","When callbacks are passed incorrect arguments","When callbacks are deeply nested inside each other, making code hard to read and maintain","When too many callbacks are defined in a single JavaScript file"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"\\"Callback hell\\" (also known as \\"pyramid of doom\\") refers to deeply nested callbacks that make code difficult to read, understand, and maintain. This typically occurs in asynchronous programming when multiple sequential operations depend on the results of previous operations. Each level of nesting creates more indentation, eventually resembling a pyramid shape. Modern JavaScript features like Promises, async/await, and libraries like async.js were developed specifically to address this problem by providing more linear and readable ways to handle asynchronous code."},{"id":271,"question":"What happens in this code snippet?","code":"function outer() {\\n  const x = 10;\\n  return function inner(y) {\\n    return x + y;\\n  };\\n}\\n\\nconst addTen = outer();\\nconsole.log(addTen(5));","options":["It throws an error because x is not defined in the inner function","It outputs 15","It outputs 10","It outputs undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The code outputs 15. This is an example of a higher-order function (outer) that returns another function (inner). The inner function forms a closure, which means it retains access to its lexical scope - including the variable x from its parent function - even after the parent function has completed execution. When we call outer(), it returns the inner function, which we assign to addTen. When we call addTen(5), the inner function executes with y=5 and adds it to x=10, resulting in 15."},{"id":272,"question":"What is function currying in JavaScript?","options":["A technique for optimizing recursive functions","A method of debugging higher-order functions","A technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument","A way to prevent callback hell"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Function currying is a technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. It\'s named after mathematician Haskell Curry. Currying lets you create specialized versions of more general functions by pre-filling some of the arguments. For example, instead of calling add(1, 2, 3), currying would let you decompose this into add(1)(2)(3). This technique is powerful for function composition and creating reusable, specialized function variants."},{"id":273,"question":"What does the following code demonstrate?","code":"function multiplier(factor) {\\n  return function(number) {\\n    return number * factor;\\n  };\\n}\\n\\nconst double = multiplier(2);\\nconst triple = multiplier(3);\\n\\nconsole.log(double(5)); // 10\\nconsole.log(triple(5)); // 15","options":["Callback hell","Function currying","A simple higher-order function with closure","Recursion"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"This code demonstrates a simple higher-order function with closure. The multiplier function returns a new function that remembers the factor value through closure. When we call multiplier(2), it returns a function that will multiply any input by 2, which we assign to double. Similarly, triple will multiply any input by 3. This pattern allows us to create specialized functions from a more general one. While this has similarities to currying (partial application of arguments), true currying would transform a function taking multiple arguments into a sequence of single-argument functions."},{"id":274,"question":"What\'s the output of this Array.filter() example?","code":"const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\\nconst evens = numbers.filter(function(num) {\\n  return num % 2 === 0;\\n});\\nconsole.log(evens);","options":["[1, 3, 5]","[2, 4, 6]","[]","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output is [2, 4, 6]. The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided callback function. The callback in this example checks if a number is even by testing if the remainder when divided by 2 equals 0. Only the even numbers (2, 4, and 6) pass this test and are included in the resulting array. filter() is a higher-order function that doesn\'t modify the original array but returns a new array with the filtered elements."},{"id":275,"question":"What concept is demonstrated in this code?","code":"function debounce(func, delay) {\\n  let timeoutId;\\n  return function(...args) {\\n    clearTimeout(timeoutId);\\n    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {\\n      func.apply(this, args);\\n    }, delay);\\n  };\\n}","options":["Recursion","Memoization","Function debouncing using higher-order functions","Callback hell"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"This code demonstrates function debouncing using higher-order functions. Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, making them more efficient. The debounce function returns a new function that, when called, will postpone its execution until after the specified delay has elapsed since the last time it was invoked. This is commonly used for performance optimization with events that might fire rapidly (like window resizing, scrolling, or keystrokes). The implementation uses closures, higher-order functions, and setTimeout to manage the timing of function calls."},{"id":276,"question":"What\'s the purpose of the Function.prototype.bind() method?","options":["To create a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element","To create a new function with a bound this value and optionally pre-filled arguments","To test whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function","To execute a reducer function on each element of the array"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The Function.prototype.bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its \'this\' keyword set to a specific value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. This is incredibly useful for maintaining context when functions are passed around or used as callbacks. Unlike call() and apply(), which invoke the function immediately, bind() returns a new function with the bound context and arguments. This is particularly helpful when you need to preserve a specific \'this\' value in a callback function."},{"id":277,"question":"What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous callbacks?","options":["Synchronous callbacks can only be used with arrow functions, while asynchronous callbacks can use any function syntax","Synchronous callbacks execute immediately within the function call flow, while asynchronous callbacks execute later, after the function has returned","Synchronous callbacks are deprecated in modern JavaScript","Asynchronous callbacks can only be used with Promises or async/await"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Synchronous callbacks execute immediately within the function call flow, while asynchronous callbacks execute later, after the function has returned. Synchronous callbacks block the execution flow until they complete (examples include Array methods like map, filter, and reduce). Asynchronous callbacks don\'t block execution; instead, they\'re typically triggered by events, timers, or the completion of I/O operations (examples include setTimeout, event listeners, and fetch API callbacks). Understanding this distinction is crucial for writing efficient JavaScript code and avoiding performance bottlenecks."},{"id":278,"question":"What will the following code output?","code":"const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\\nconst sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, current) => {\\n  return accumulator + current;\\n}, 0);\\nconsole.log(sum);","options":["15","0","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]","Error"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The code will output 15. The reduce() method executes a reducer callback function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. It takes two parameters: the callback function and an initial value (in this case, 0). The callback receives an accumulator (which stores the accumulated result) and the current value being processed. In this example, reduce() adds each array element to the accumulator, resulting in the sum of all numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. This demonstrates how reduce() is a powerful higher-order function for aggregating array values."},{"id":279,"question":"In the context of higher-order functions, what is partial application?","options":["A technique where a function is applied multiple times to its own result","A process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity","A method of optimizing recursive functions to avoid stack overflow","A way to apply CSS styles partially to DOM elements using JavaScript"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Partial application is a process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity (accepting fewer arguments). Unlike currying, which transforms a function to take one argument at a time, partial application fixes some arguments and returns a function that takes the remaining arguments all at once. For example, if we have a function add(a, b, c), we could partially apply it with add(1, 2) to get a new function that only needs the c parameter. This technique is useful for creating specialized functions from more general ones and for composing functions together."},{"id":280,"question":"What is a pure function in functional programming?","options":["A function that doesn\'t use any callbacks","A function written in pure JavaScript without any libraries","A function that has no side effects and always returns the same output for the same input","A function that only uses arrow function syntax"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"A pure function is a function that has no side effects and always returns the same output for the same input. Side effects include modifying external variables, making API calls, or performing I/O operations. Pure functions are a fundamental concept in functional programming because they make code more predictable, testable, and easier to reason about. Since pure functions only depend on their inputs and don\'t modify external state, they can be safely composed, memoized, and parallelized. Higher-order functions in JavaScript are often designed to work with pure functions as callbacks for maximum composability and predictability."},{"id":281,"question":"What does the following composition of higher-order functions do?","code":"const result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\n  .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)\\n  .map(n => n * n)\\n  .reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0);","options":["Sums all square numbers in the array","Returns the square of all numbers in the array","Sums the squares of all even numbers in the array","Returns the even numbers in the array"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"This code sums the squares of all even numbers in the array. It demonstrates function composition with higher-order functions, processing data in a pipeline. First, filter() selects only even numbers [2, 4], then map() transforms each number to its square [4, 16], and finally reduce() sums these values to produce 20. This functional approach allows for a declarative, step-by-step data transformation that\'s readable and maintainable. Each function in the chain takes the output of the previous function as its input, enabling complex operations to be broken down into simple, composable pieces."},{"id":281,"question":"Which method would you use to ensure a callback executes exactly once, regardless of how many times a function is called?","options":["Function.prototype.call()","Function.prototype.once() (fictional method)","You would need to implement this functionality manually","Function.prototype.apply()"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"JavaScript doesn\'t have a built-in Function.prototype.once() method, so you would need to implement this functionality manually. This pattern is often called a \'once function\' and is useful when you need to ensure that a callback executes only once, such as for initialization code or cleanup operations. Libraries like Lodash provide a _.once() utility for this purpose. A simple implementation could use closure to track whether the function has been called already:\\n\\n```javascript\\nfunction once(fn) {\\n  let called = false;\\n  return function(...args) {\\n    if (!called) {\\n      called = true;\\n      return fn.apply(this, args);\\n    }\\n  };\\n}\\n```"}]}')},48048:function(e){"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"id":10,"title":"Default Parameters","seoTitle":"JavaScript Default Parameters Quiz - ES6 Function Defaults","description":"Test your knowledge of JavaScript\'s default parameters feature introduced in ES6.

This feature allows function parameters to have predefined values if no value or undefined is passed during invocation. Before ES6, developers had to use workarounds like the logical OR operator (`param = param || defaultValue`) or conditional statements to achieve similar functionality. These workarounds had limitations, particularly when dealing with falsy values that were valid inputs (such as 0 or an empty string). The introduction of proper default parameters in ES6 provided a cleaner, more intuitive syntax and resolved these edge cases. This addition was part of ES6\'s larger goal to enhance JavaScript\'s expressiveness and make common programming patterns more concise and less error-prone."},{"id":222,"question":"What is the correct syntax for defining a default parameter in JavaScript?","options":["function example(a: 1, b: 2) { }","function example(a = 1, b = 2) { }","function example(a || 1, b || 2) { }","function example(a default 1, b default 2) { }"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The correct syntax for defining default parameters in JavaScript is `function example(a = 1, b = 2) { }`. This syntax uses the assignment operator (`=`) after the parameter name, followed by the default value. Default parameters are evaluated at call time, so each time the function is called, the default values are newly evaluated. If you call the function without an argument or with the explicit value `undefined` for a particular parameter, the default value will be used. However, other falsy values like `null`, `false`, `0`, or an empty string will be treated as valid inputs and override the default value. This distinction between `undefined` and other falsy values is important and addresses limitations of pre-ES6 workarounds that would incorrectly apply defaults for any falsy value."},{"id":223,"question":"What happens when you pass \'undefined\' to a parameter with a default value?","options":["It causes a TypeError","The parameter keeps the value \'undefined\'","The default value is used","The function execution is skipped"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"When you pass `undefined` to a parameter with a default value, the default value is used. JavaScript treats explicitly passing `undefined` the same as not passing a value at all for that parameter. This is a key aspect of how default parameters work. For example, in `function greet(name = \'Guest\') { return `Hello, ${name}`; }`, calling `greet(undefined)` will result in `\'Hello, Guest\'`. This behavior allows you to selectively use default values even in the middle of a parameter list—you can pass `undefined` as a placeholder to use a default while providing values for later parameters. This is different from passing other falsy values like `null`, `false`, `0`, or an empty string, which are treated as intentional values and will override the default parameter values."},{"id":224,"question":"What is the value of y after this code runs? function test(x, y = 10) { return y; } const y = test(5, undefined);","options":["5","10","undefined","Error"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The value of y after this code runs is 10. When the function is called with `test(5, undefined)`, the first parameter `x` gets the value 5, and the second parameter `y` receives `undefined`. Since `undefined` is explicitly passed for the parameter `y`, which has a default value of 10, the default value is applied. The function then returns this default value. This example demonstrates how default parameters behave when `undefined` is explicitly passed—they work exactly the same as if no value was provided at all. This is useful in scenarios where you might need to use the default for one parameter but not others, or when working with function calls where some arguments might be dynamically generated as `undefined`."},{"id":225,"question":"What will be logged to the console? function multiply(a, b = 2) { return a * b; } console.log(multiply(5));","options":["5","10","NaN","undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The code will log `10` to the console. In the function call `multiply(5)`, only one argument is provided, which is assigned to the parameter `a`. Since no value is provided for the parameter `b`, its default value of 2 is used. The function then calculates 5 * 2, resulting in 10. This is a simple example of how default parameters can make functions more flexible. Without default parameters, this function would either need additional logic to handle the missing second argument or would return `NaN` (since multiplying a number by `undefined` results in `NaN`). Default parameters allow you to write more concise code by eliminating boilerplate parameter checking while still providing full flexibility for callers to override the defaults when needed."},{"id":226,"question":"What will be logged? function test(a = 1, b) { return [a, b]; } console.log(test(undefined, 5));","options":["[undefined, 5]","[1, 5]","[1, undefined]","Error: required parameters cannot follow default parameters"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The code will log `[1, 5]`. When the function is called with `test(undefined, 5)`, `undefined` is explicitly passed for parameter `a`, which has a default value of 1. Since `undefined` triggers the use of default parameters, `a` becomes 1. The second argument 5 is assigned to parameter `b`. Contrary to what some might expect, it is perfectly valid in JavaScript to have parameters without defaults following parameters with defaults. There is no syntax or runtime error for this. However, it\'s generally considered a good practice to position parameters with default values after parameters without defaults to improve readability, since required parameters conceptually come before optional ones. But the JavaScript language itself does not enforce this convention, and the function works correctly regardless of parameter order."},{"id":227,"question":"Can a default parameter reference earlier parameters in its declaration?","options":["No, default parameters cannot reference any other parameters","Yes, but only global variables, not other parameters","Yes, default parameters can reference earlier parameters in the same function signature","Yes, but only if using the \'this\' keyword"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Yes, default parameters can reference earlier parameters in the same function signature. When a default parameter expression is evaluated, all previous parameters in the parameter list are already initialized and can be used in the expression. For example: `function createRect(width, height = width) { return { width, height }; }`. Calling `createRect(10)` creates a square with width and height both equal to 10. This works because `width` is already defined when the default value for `height` is evaluated. However, a default parameter cannot reference parameters that are declared after it in the list (parameters to its right), as those haven\'t been initialized yet when the default expression is evaluated. This creates a left-to-right evaluation order that you need to be aware of when designing functions with interdependent default parameters."},{"id":228,"question":"What is the result of this code? function add(x, y = x + 1) { return x + y; } console.log(add(5));","options":["5","10","11","NaN"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The result of this code is `11`. When the function is called with `add(5)`, the parameter `x` gets the value 5. Since no value is provided for `y`, its default value is calculated as `x + 1`, which is 5 + 1 = 6. The function then returns `x + y`, which is 5 + 6 = 11. This example demonstrates how default parameters can be expressions that reference earlier parameters, allowing for dynamic defaults based on other inputs. This capability enables powerful patterns like creating related values, maintaining proportional relationships between parameters, or implementing more complex defaulting logic that goes beyond simple static values. It\'s important to remember that this only works for parameters that appear earlier in the parameter list, as the parameters are processed from left to right."},{"id":229,"question":"What is the result of this code? function greet(name = getName()) { return `Hello, ${name}`; } function getName() { return \'Guest\'; } console.log(greet());","options":["\'Hello, undefined\'","\'Hello, getName()\'","\'Hello, Guest\'","TypeError: getName is not defined"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The result of this code is `\'Hello, Guest\'`. Default parameter expressions, including function calls, are evaluated at call time, not when the function is defined. When `greet()` is called without arguments, the default parameter `name = getName()` is activated. The function `getName()` is executed, returning the string `\'Guest\'`, which becomes the value of the `name` parameter. This demonstrates that default parameters can be dynamic and invoke functions to determine their values. This is particularly useful for generating default values that need to be computed or retrieved from external sources. Note that the function call occurs only when needed—if a value is provided for the parameter, the default expression is not evaluated. This behavior allows for efficient lazy evaluation of potentially expensive default value calculations."},{"id":230,"question":"What happens when you use the default parameter value in conjunction with object destructuring?","options":["It\'s not possible to combine default parameters with destructuring","Default values can be applied to the entire destructuring parameter, but not to individual destructured properties","Default values can be applied both to the entire destructuring parameter and to individual destructured properties","Destructuring automatically applies default values without explicit syntax"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Default values can be applied both to the entire destructuring parameter and to individual destructured properties. This creates a powerful combination for handling complex function parameters. For example: `function processUser({ name = \'Anonymous\', role = \'User\' } = {}) { ... }`. In this function, if no object is passed at all, the empty object default `= {}` ensures destructuring won\'t fail. Additionally, if the passed object is missing the `name` or `role` properties, their respective default values (\'Anonymous\' and \'User\') will be used. This two-level defaulting provides great flexibility and robustness. You can destructure arrays with defaults similarly: `function getCoordinates([x = 0, y = 0] = []) { ... }`. This pattern is commonly used in modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks to create functions with numerous optional parameters while maintaining a clean interface and providing sensible defaults."},{"id":231,"question":"What is the output of this code? function logValues(a = 1, b = a, c = a + b) { console.log(a, b, c); } logValues(2);","options":["1, 1, 2","2, 1, 3","2, 2, 4","2, undefined, NaN"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The output of this code is `2, 2, 4`. When `logValues(2)` is called, the parameter `a` gets the value 2. Since no values are provided for `b` and `c`, their default values are used. The default value for `b` is `a`, which is now 2. The default value for `c` is `a + b`, which is 2 + 2 = 4. This example demonstrates the chaining of default parameters, where each parameter can reference previously defined parameters in its default expression. This creates a cascading effect where changing the value of an earlier parameter affects the defaults of later parameters. This feature allows you to maintain relationships between parameters and create more dynamic function interfaces. The parameters are processed from left to right during function invocation, ensuring that each default expression has access to all previously defined parameter values."},{"id":232,"question":"What happens if you try to reference a parameter in its own default expression?","options":["It works normally, creating a recursive default","It causes a SyntaxError","It results in the parameter having the value undefined","It throws a ReferenceError when the function is called without that parameter"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"If you try to reference a parameter in its own default expression, it will throw a ReferenceError when the function is called without that parameter. For example, with `function broken(x = x) { ... }`, calling `broken()` causes a ReferenceError: \\"Cannot access \'x\' before initialization\\". This happens because of the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)—the period from the start of the block until the variable (parameter in this case) is declared and initialized. During parameter evaluation, each parameter creates a new scope, and the parameter\'s default value is evaluated within a TDZ for the parameter itself. So when evaluating `x = x`, the `x` on the right side is in the TDZ and cannot be accessed yet. This is different from referring to previously defined parameters, which work fine because they\'re already initialized when later parameters are evaluated."},{"id":233,"question":"What will be logged? function display(a, b = 5, c = b) { console.log(a, b, c); } display(1, undefined, 3);","options":["1, 5, 3","1, undefined, 3","1, 5, 5","1, undefined, undefined"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The code will log `1, 5, 3`. When the function is called with `display(1, undefined, 3)`, the parameter `a` gets the value 1. The second argument is `undefined`, which triggers the default value for parameter `b`, making it 5. The third argument is 3, which is explicitly provided for parameter `c`, overriding its default value. This example illustrates how default parameters interact with explicitly passed values, including `undefined`. It\'s important to understand that default values only kick in when the parameter receives `undefined` or when no argument is provided. In this case, even though `b`\'s default value is used (because `undefined` was passed), `c` doesn\'t use its default (which would have been the value of `b`) because an explicit value (3) was provided for it. This demonstrates the flexibility of default parameters in handling various calling patterns."},{"id":234,"question":"What will be the output of this code? function createUser(id, { name = \'Anonymous\', age = 0 } = {}) { return { id, name, age }; } console.log(createUser(1));","options":["{ id: 1, name: undefined, age: undefined }","{ id: 1, name: null, age: null }","{ id: 1, name: \'Anonymous\', age: 0 }","TypeError: Cannot destructure property \'name\' of undefined"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The output will be `{ id: 1, name: \'Anonymous\', age: 0 }`. This function demonstrates a common pattern for handling optional object parameters with defaults. When `createUser(1)` is called, only the `id` parameter receives a value. The second parameter is not provided, so its default value (an empty object `{}`) is used. Then, destructuring is applied to this empty object, with default values for the `name` and `age` properties. Since these properties don\'t exist in the empty object, their respective default values (\'Anonymous\' and 0) are used. This pattern is particularly useful for functions with many optional parameters, as it provides a clean interface while ensuring the function doesn\'t throw errors when properties are missing. The empty object default (`= {}`) is crucial—without it, passing no second argument would cause a TypeError when trying to destructure `undefined`."},{"id":235,"question":"What is the key advantage of using default parameters over the old pattern of checking arguments inside the function body?","options":["Default parameters improve performance significantly","Default parameters work with strict mode while the old pattern doesn\'t","Default parameters provide clear, self-documenting function signatures","Default parameters can handle complex types while the old pattern cannot"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The key advantage of using default parameters is that they provide clear, self-documenting function signatures. With default parameters, anyone reading the function declaration can immediately see what parameters are optional and what their default values are, without having to examine the function body. This improves code readability and maintainability. In contrast, the old pattern of checking arguments inside the function body (e.g., `x = x || defaultValue;`) obscures the function\'s interface by mixing parameter handling with business logic. Additionally, default parameters handle edge cases better, particularly with falsy values. The old OR (`||`) pattern would incorrectly apply defaults for valid falsy inputs like 0 or empty strings, whereas default parameters only activate when the value is actually missing (`undefined`). Default parameters also reduce boilerplate code, resulting in cleaner, more concise functions, and they better support type-checking and IDE hints in modern development environments."},{"id":236,"question":"What does the following code output? function test(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3) { console.log(arguments.length); } test(5, undefined, 10);","options":["0","2","3","5"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The code outputs `3`. The `arguments` object in JavaScript functions reflects the number of arguments actually passed to the function, regardless of default parameters. In this case, three arguments were passed to the function: 5, undefined, and 10. Even though the second argument is `undefined` (which triggers the default parameter), it still counts as a passed argument in the `arguments` object. This is an important distinction—default parameters affect the values the parameters receive, but they don\'t change what\'s stored in the `arguments` object. Note that `arguments` doesn\'t reflect the final parameter values after defaults are applied; it only contains what was explicitly passed. Also be aware that arrow functions don\'t have their own `arguments` object, so this behavior applies only to functions defined with the `function` keyword. This distinction can be important when refactoring code that relies on examining the `arguments` object."},{"id":237,"question":"Which of the following is true about default parameters and the \'arguments\' object?","options":["Default parameters replace the need for the arguments object entirely","The arguments object includes default parameter values when they\'re used","The arguments object only contains explicitly passed arguments, not default values","Default parameters cannot be used in functions that access the arguments object"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The arguments object only contains explicitly passed arguments, not default values. When a function is called and a parameter uses its default value (either because the corresponding argument was not provided or because `undefined` was explicitly passed), that default value doesn\'t appear in the `arguments` object. For example, in `function test(a = 1) { console.log(arguments[0], a); }`, calling `test()` would log `undefined, 1`—the `arguments` object doesn\'t have a value at index 0, but the parameter `a` receives its default value of 1. Similarly, `arguments.length` reflects only the number of arguments that were explicitly passed, not the number of parameters that received values (including defaults). This separation allows default parameters to coexist with code that uses the `arguments` object, though modern JavaScript often favors rest parameters (`...args`) over the `arguments` object for better clarity and compatibility with arrow functions."},{"id":238,"question":"What will be logged? function demo(a, b = () => console.log(a)) { a = 5; b(); } demo(3);","options":["3","5","undefined","ReferenceError: a is not defined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The code will log `5`. When `demo(3)` is called, the parameter `a` is initialized with the value 3. The parameter `b` gets its default value, which is an arrow function referencing `a`. Inside the function body, `a` is reassigned to 5 before `b()` is called. When `b()` executes, it accesses the current value of `a`, which is 5. This example demonstrates two important concepts: 1) Default parameter expressions can reference other parameters, and 2) Arrow functions capture variables by reference, not by value. The arrow function doesn\'t capture the initial value of `a` (3), but rather maintains a reference to the variable `a`. When the value of `a` changes before the function is called, the arrow function sees the updated value. This behavior can be both powerful and potentially confusing, so it\'s important to understand how closures and variable references work when using functions as default parameters."},{"id":239,"question":"What happens when you use a function call with side effects as a default parameter?","options":["The function is called once when the outer function is defined","The function is called every time the outer function is called, but only if the parameter is missing","The function is called every time the outer function is called, regardless of whether the parameter is provided","The function is never actually called, it\'s just stored as a reference"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"When you use a function call with side effects as a default parameter, the function is called every time the outer function is called, but only if the parameter is missing or explicitly set to `undefined`. For example, in `function logTime(time = Date.now()) { console.log(time); }`, the `Date.now()` function (which has the side effect of retrieving the current timestamp) will be called each time `logTime()` is invoked without an argument. However, it won\'t be called if a value is provided: `logTime(1234567890)` would simply use the provided value. This lazy evaluation behavior is efficient, as potentially expensive operations are only performed when needed. However, it\'s important to be aware of this behavior when the default value function has side effects (like logging, modifying state, or making API calls), as these side effects will occur each time the default is applied, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if not properly accounted for in your design."},{"id":240,"question":"What will be logged? const b = 2; function test(a = b, b = 3) { console.log(a, b); } test();","options":["2, 3","undefined, 3","ReferenceError: Cannot access \'b\' before initialization","3, 3"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"This code will throw a `ReferenceError: Cannot access \'b\' before initialization`. The error occurs because default parameter expressions create their own scope, and parameters are initialized from left to right. When evaluating the default value for parameter `a`, the expression refers to `b`. However, at this point in the parameter list, the parameter `b` exists but hasn\'t been initialized yet—it\'s in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ). The `b` referenced in `a = b` refers to the parameter `b`, not the global `b` variable with value 2, because the parameter shadows the global variable in this scope. This example demonstrates the TDZ for default parameters—you can reference parameters that appear earlier in the list (to the left), but not those that appear later (to the right), as they\'re not yet initialized. To fix this issue, you could either reorder the parameters, use a different name for one of the variables, or explicitly pass a value for parameter `a` to avoid using its default value."},{"id":241,"question":"What will this code log? function greeting(name = \'Guest\') { let name = \'User\'; return `Hello, ${name}`; } console.log(greeting());","options":["\'Hello, Guest\'","\'Hello, User\'","ReferenceError: name is not defined","SyntaxError: Identifier \'name\' has already been declared"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"This code will throw a `SyntaxError: Identifier \'name\' has already been declared`. In JavaScript, function parameters create variables in the function scope. Attempting to declare a variable with the same name using `let`, `const`, or `var` within the same scope will cause a SyntaxError. The parameter `name` (with its default value \'Guest\') is already a variable in the function scope, so declaring another variable with `let name = \'User\'` in the same scope is not allowed. This error occurs at parse time, before the function is ever executed. To fix this issue, you would need to use a different variable name inside the function, or simply reassign the parameter value without redeclaring it (e.g., `name = \'User\'` without the `let` keyword). This behavior is consistent with how variables work in JavaScript—identifiers must be unique within a given scope, whether they\'re introduced as parameters, `let`/`const`/`var` declarations, function declarations, or other binding forms."}]}')},84930:function(e){"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"title":"Functions and Scope","description":"Explore JavaScript\'s functions and scope concepts with our comprehensive quizzes covering closures, this keyword, scoping rules, arrow functions, hoisting, and execution context.

Instead of taking multiple arguments at once like `add(a, b)`, this curried version takes the first argument and returns a new function that takes the second argument.

The outer function captures the first argument in its closure, and the returned inner function uses that captured value along with its own argument to compute the final result."},{"id":309,"question":"What\'s the output of this curried function call?","code":"const multiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;\\nconst double = multiply(2);\\nconst result = double(5);\\nconsole.log(result);","options":["7","10","25","Error: double is not a function"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output is 10. The `multiply` function is a curried function that takes two arguments one at a time. First, we call `multiply(2)` which returns a new function that multiplies its argument by 2. We assign this function to the variable `double`. When we call `double(5)`, we\'re actually calling the inner function with `b = 5`, and since `a = 2` was captured in the closure, the result is 2 * 5 = 10.

Partial application, on the other hand, fixes (or \'applies\') a number of arguments to a function, producing a new function that takes the remaining arguments. With currying, a 3-argument function becomes a sequence of three single-argument functions. With partial application, you might fix 2 arguments and get back a function that only needs the 3rd argument.

This code demonstrates a sophisticated curry implementation that works with functions of any arity (number of arguments). The `curry` function returns a new `curried` function that checks if it has received enough arguments to call the original function. If not, it returns another function that waits for more arguments. The `curriedSum(1)(2)(3)` call first returns a function waiting for more arguments, then another function, and finally when all three arguments are collected, it calls the original sum function with them, resulting in 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

In functional programming, it\'s common to compose functions to create new functions. When functions are curried, you can easily create specialized versions with some arguments pre-set before composing them with other functions. This leads to more reusable, modular code.

Functions are often described by their arity - unary functions take one parameter, binary functions take two, ternary functions take three, and so on. Currying transforms a function of arity n into n functions of arity 1. This transformation is significant in functional programming because it standardizes functions to a form that\'s easier to compose and work with. Understanding the arity of functions is crucial when implementing currying, as it determines how many nested functions will be created and how many separate calls will be needed to fully evaluate the function."},{"id":315,"question":"Which of the following is NOT a common use case for function currying?","options":["Creating specialized functions from more general ones","Enabling point-free style programming","Improving performance by reducing the number of function calls","Simplifying function composition"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Improving performance by reducing the number of function calls is NOT a common use case for function currying.

When applied to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it first filters out [2, 4] (the even numbers), then doubles each to produce [4, 8].

In libraries like Ramda or Lodash/fp, most functions are auto-curried by default. This means they\'re designed to work both with all arguments at once or with partial application. For example, a function like `add(a, b)` would automatically become `add(a)(b)` when only one argument is provided. This design makes the entire API more consistent and composable, as any function can be easily used in function composition or partial application scenarios without additional transformation. It simplifies functional programming patterns and encourages their use throughout an application."}]}')},38952:function(e){"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"id":8,"title":"Function Declarations vs Expressions","seoTitle":"JavaScript Function Declarations vs Expressions Quiz","description":"Test your knowledge of JavaScript function types, hoisting behavior, scope chains, closures and the key differences between function declarations and expressions in this comprehensive quiz.

Function declarations are hoisted completely, meaning both the declaration and the function body are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation. This allows you to call the function before its actual declaration in the code. Function expressions, on the other hand, follow variable hoisting rules—only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function assignment. If you try to call a function defined as an expression before its definition, you\'ll get an error (typically \'not a function\'). For example, `functionName()` followed by `function functionName() {}` works fine, but `expressionName()` followed by `const expressionName = function() {}` throws an error because at the point of calling, `expressionName` is undefined, not a function."},{"id":182,"question":"Which of the following is a function declaration?","options":["const myFunc = function() {};","let myFunc = () => {};","function myFunc() {};","const myFunc = new Function(\'a\', \'b\', \'return a + b\');"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The function declaration is `function myFunc() {};`. Function declarations are defined using the `function` keyword followed immediately by a mandatory function name, a list of parameters in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in curly braces. The defining characteristic of a function declaration is that it stands alone as a statement and creates a named function. The syntax pattern is: `function name(parameters) { /* body */ }`. Function declarations are hoisted in their entirety, allowing them to be called before they appear in the code. The other options are all function expressions: storing anonymous functions or arrow functions in variables or creating functions using the Function constructor. These store function objects in variables rather than declaring a function directly."},{"id":183,"question":"What is the output of this code?","code":"foo();\\nfunction foo() {\\n  console.log(\'A\');\\n}\\nfoo();\\nfunction foo() {\\n  console.log(\'B\');\\n}\\nfoo();","options":["A, A, A","Error: foo is not a function","B, B, B","A, B, B"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The output of this code is `B, B, B`. This demonstrates function declaration hoisting and redeclaration behavior in JavaScript. When multiple functions with the same name are declared in the same scope, the later declarations override the earlier ones. During the compilation phase, all function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, and in this case, the second declaration of `foo()` (which logs \'B\') overwrites the first. By the time execution begins, only the last declaration of `foo` exists in memory. This is why all three calls to `foo()` log \'B\'—even the first call that appears before any function declaration in the code. In strict mode and in ES6 modules, redeclaring functions like this would cause an error in some environments, but in non-strict code it leads to the last declaration winning."},{"id":184,"question":"What is the output of this code?","code":"console.log(typeof bar);\\nvar bar = function() {};\\nconsole.log(typeof bar);","options":["undefined, function","function, function","undefined, undefined","Error"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The output is `undefined, function`. This demonstrates the difference in hoisting behavior between variable declarations and function assignments. When using `var bar = function() {};`, only the variable declaration (`var bar`) is hoisted to the top of the scope, not the function assignment. This means that before the assignment line, `bar` exists but has the value `undefined`, so `typeof bar` returns \'undefined\'. After the assignment line, `bar` references a function object, so `typeof bar` returns \'function\'. This behavior highlights why function expressions can\'t be used before they\'re defined in the code—unlike function declarations, which are hoisted entirely. If `bar` had been defined using a function declaration (`function bar() {}`), both `typeof` calls would return \'function\' since the entire function would be hoisted."},{"id":185,"question":"Which statement about named function expressions is correct?","options":["Named function expressions cannot be anonymous","The function name is accessible only within the function\'s body, not outside it","Named function expressions are hoisted like function declarations","Named function expressions must be assigned to a variable with the same name"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The correct statement is that in a named function expression, the function name is accessible only within the function\'s body, not outside it. A named function expression looks like `const myFunc = function innerName() {};`. Here, `innerName` is only accessible within the function\'s own scope—it\'s not defined in the outer scope. This name is primarily useful for self-reference (recursion), providing more meaningful stack traces during debugging, and improving code clarity. Unlike function declarations, named function expressions are not hoisted in their entirety—only the variable they\'re assigned to follows variable hoisting rules. The function name does not create a variable in the outer scope. If you tried to call `innerName()` outside the function, it would result in a ReferenceError, but inside the function, `innerName` refers to the function itself."},{"id":186,"question":"What will this code output?","code":"let greeting = function sayHello() {\\n  console.log(typeof sayHello);\\n};\\ngreeting();\\nconsole.log(typeof sayHello);","options":["function, function","function, undefined","undefined, undefined","function, ReferenceError"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"This code will output `function` followed by a `ReferenceError`. The first line creates a named function expression `sayHello` and assigns it to the variable `greeting`. When `greeting()` is called, it executes the function body, which logs the type of `sayHello`. Inside the function, `sayHello` refers to the function itself, so `typeof sayHello` is \'function\'. However, the function name in a named function expression is only accessible within the function\'s own scope, not in the outer scope. Therefore, when trying to access `sayHello` in the global scope with `console.log(typeof sayHello)`, JavaScript throws a ReferenceError because `sayHello` is not defined in that scope. Only `greeting` is accessible in the outer scope, not the internal function name `sayHello`. This demonstrates the scope limitation of named function expressions, which is useful for recursion and debugging but not for external access."},{"id":187,"question":"What is the primary advantage of using a function expression over a function declaration?","options":["Function expressions are always faster than function declarations","Function expressions can be used as closures while declarations cannot","Function expressions can be used immediately as Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)","Function expressions support more advanced features than declarations"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The primary advantage of function expressions over function declarations is that function expressions can be used immediately as Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs). Since function expressions produce a value (a function object) rather than a declaration, they can be invoked immediately by appending parentheses: `(function() { /* code */ })();`. This pattern is impossible with function declarations. IIFEs are valuable for creating private scopes to avoid polluting the global namespace, executing code that doesn\'t need to be reused, and creating closures with private variables. Function expressions are also more flexible in how they can be used: they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, assigned conditionally, and used in all the ways that any other value can be used. Both expression and declaration types support closures and have similar performance characteristics."},{"id":188,"question":"What is the output of the following code?","code":"console.log(add(2, 3));\\nvar add = function(a, b) {\\n  return a + b;\\n};","options":["5","undefined","TypeError: add is not a function","ReferenceError: add is not defined"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The output will be `TypeError: add is not a function`. This error occurs due to how variable hoisting works with function expressions. When JavaScript processes this code, it hoists the variable declaration `var add` to the top of the scope, but not the function assignment. So at the point where `console.log(add(2, 3))` is executed, `add` exists as a variable but its value is `undefined`, not a function. Therefore, attempting to call it as a function results in a TypeError. This is different from function declarations (e.g., `function add(a, b) { return a + b; }`), which are hoisted completely and can be called before their declaration in the code. This example demonstrates one of the key practical differences between function declarations and expressions: expressions cannot be used before they appear in the code, while declarations can."},{"id":189,"question":"In which scenario would an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) be most appropriate?","options":["When you need to reuse a function multiple times","When you need to create a function that\'s accessible throughout your codebase","When you need to create a private scope to avoid polluting the global namespace","When you need the best possible performance for function calls"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is most appropriate when you need to create a private scope to avoid polluting the global namespace. The IIFE pattern creates a function expression that executes immediately: `(function() { /* code */ })();`. This creates a new scope that\'s isolated from the surrounding code, allowing you to declare variables and functions that won\'t conflict with variables in other scopes, even if they have the same name. This is particularly useful for encapsulating initialization code, creating modules with private state, avoiding global namespace pollution, and preventing variables from persisting in memory when they\'re no longer needed. IIFEs were especially important before ES6 modules and block-scoped variables (let/const), as they provided one of the few ways to create private scopes in JavaScript. They\'re still valuable for one-time execution code that needs its own scope."},{"id":190,"question":"What\'s the output of this code?","code":"var f = function g() { return 23; };\\nconsole.log(typeof g());","options":["number","function","undefined","ReferenceError"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"The output will be a `ReferenceError`. This code creates a named function expression where `g` is the function name and `f` is the variable to which the function is assigned. In a named function expression, the function name (in this case, `g`) is only accessible within the function\'s own scope, not in the outer scope where the `console.log` statement is trying to access it. Since `g` is not defined in the outer scope, attempting to call `g()` results in a ReferenceError. This demonstrates an important aspect of named function expressions: the function name provides an internal reference that\'s useful for recursion within the function or for more informative stack traces during debugging, but it doesn\'t create a binding in the surrounding scope. Only the variable name (`f` in this case) can be used to reference the function from outside."},{"id":191,"question":"Which of the following correctly creates a function that doubles a number using an arrow function expression?","options":["const double = n => { return n * 2 };","const double = n => n * 2;","const double = function(n) { n * 2 };","function double(n) => n * 2;"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The correct way to create a function that doubles a number using an arrow function expression is `const double = n => n * 2;`. This is a concise arrow function that takes a single parameter `n` and implicitly returns the result of `n * 2`. Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 and offer a more compact syntax for function expressions. When an arrow function has a single parameter, the parentheses around the parameter list are optional. When the function body consists of a single expression, the curly braces and `return` keyword can be omitted, and the expression\'s result is implicitly returned. This makes arrow functions particularly elegant for short, simple operations. Option 1 is also valid but less concise because it explicitly uses a return statement. Option 3 is missing a return statement (so it would return undefined). Option 4 is invalid syntax that mixes function declaration and arrow function syntax."},{"id":192,"question":"What\'s the difference in `this` binding between standard function expressions and arrow function expressions?","options":["There is no difference; `this` works the same in both function types","Arrow functions don\'t have their own `this` and inherit it from the surrounding scope","Standard functions don\'t have access to `this` while arrow functions do","Arrow functions always bind `this` to the global object"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The key difference is that arrow functions don\'t have their own `this` binding and instead inherit `this` from the surrounding lexical context (the enclosing function or global scope). Standard function expressions create their own `this` binding, which is determined by how the function is called (the call site). This difference makes arrow functions particularly useful for callbacks and methods that need to access `this` from their parent scope, as they don\'t lose the context. For example, in a method with a callback like `setTimeout`, using an arrow function will preserve the `this` value from the method, whereas a standard function would have its own `this` (typically the global object or undefined in strict mode). This behavior of arrow functions eliminates common issues with `this` in JavaScript and reduces the need for workarounds like `var self = this` or `Function.prototype.bind()`."},{"id":193,"question":"What is the scope chain in JavaScript?","options":["A linked list of function objects in memory","The order in which functions are called during execution","A series of nested contexts that JavaScript uses to resolve variable lookups","A data structure that stores all global variables"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The scope chain in JavaScript is a series of nested contexts that JavaScript uses to resolve variable lookups. When code tries to access a variable, JavaScript first looks in the current scope (local scope). If the variable isn\'t found there, it looks up the chain to the parent scope, then that scope\'s parent, and so on until it reaches the global scope. This chain of nested scopes forms the scope chain. Each function in JavaScript creates its own scope, and functions defined inside other functions have access to their parent function\'s scope. This hierarchical arrangement allows inner functions to access variables from their outer functions (creating closures) but not vice versa. The scope chain is determined lexically (by the physical location of the code in the source), not by the call stack. Understanding the scope chain is essential for predicting how variable lookups will be resolved and for creating proper closures in JavaScript."},{"id":194,"question":"What will this code output?","code":"function outer() {\\n  var x = 10;\\n  return function inner() {\\n    console.log(x);\\n  };\\n}\\nvar closureFn = outer();\\nclosureFn();","options":["10","undefined","ReferenceError: x is not defined","null"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"This code will output `10`. This example demonstrates a closure in JavaScript. A closure is formed when a function retains access to variables from its parent scope even after that parent function has finished executing. In this case, the `outer` function defines a variable `x` and returns the `inner` function, which references `x`. When `outer()` is called, it creates a variable `x` with the value `10` and returns the `inner` function, which we store in `closureFn`. Even though `outer` has finished executing at this point, the `inner` function (now assigned to `closureFn`) still maintains access to `x` through its scope chain. When `closureFn()` is later called, it can still access and log the value of `x` (which is 10), even though `x` was defined in `outer`, which is no longer in the call stack. This ability for functions to remember their lexical environment is a powerful feature of JavaScript that enables many programming patterns."},{"id":195,"question":"What happens when you create a function declaration inside an if statement?","options":["The function is only defined if the condition is true","It\'s treated as a function expression and assigned to a variable","It causes a syntax error because function declarations aren\'t allowed in blocks","It creates a function in the enclosing function or global scope, regardless of the condition"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"Traditionally in JavaScript, when you create a function declaration inside an if statement or any block, it creates a function in the enclosing function or global scope, regardless of the condition. This is because function declarations were historically hoisted to their containing function or global scope, not block scope. However, this behavior is considered problematic and inconsistent across browsers, which is why it\'s specified as undefined behavior in ECMAScript specifications. Modern JavaScript environments (with strict mode or ES6) have more consistent behavior, but it\'s still best practice to avoid function declarations inside blocks. If you need conditional function creation, use function expressions with appropriate variables: `if (condition) { const myFunc = function() { ... }; }`. This creates a function only when the condition is true and binds it to a block-scoped variable, which is more predictable and maintainable."},{"id":196,"question":"Which of these statements about closures is false?","options":["Closures allow functions to access variables from an outer function scope even after the outer function has returned","Every function in JavaScript creates a closure","Closures consume memory because they prevent variables from being garbage collected","Closures only work with function expressions, not function declarations"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"The false statement is that closures only work with function expressions, not function declarations. In fact, closures work with all functions in JavaScript, regardless of whether they are created using function declarations, function expressions, or arrow functions. A closure is formed whenever a function accesses variables from its outer lexical environment. This capability is a fundamental part of how JavaScript functions work, not limited to a specific syntax for creating functions. Both function declarations (`function name() {}`) and function expressions (`const name = function() {}`) can create closures if they reference variables from their outer scopes. The ability to form closures is related to the lexical scoping mechanism in JavaScript, not to the specific syntax used to define the function. This is why closures are such a powerful and ubiquitous pattern in JavaScript programming."},{"id":197,"question":"What will be the output of this code?","code":"function createCounter() {\\n  let count = 0;\\n  return {\\n    increment: function() { count += 1; },\\n    getCount: function() { return count; }\\n  };\\n}\\nconst counter = createCounter();\\ncounter.increment();\\ncounter.increment();\\nconsole.log(counter.getCount());","options":["0","1","2","undefined"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"This code will output `2`. It demonstrates a practical use of closures to create a private variable. The `createCounter` function defines a local variable `count` and returns an object with two methods, `increment` and `getCount`. Both methods form closures over the `count` variable, meaning they maintain access to it even after `createCounter` has finished executing. When we call `createCounter()`, it initializes `count` to 0 and returns the object with the two methods. We store this object in `counter`. Then we call `counter.increment()` twice, which adds 1 to `count` each time, bringing its value to 2. Finally, we call `counter.getCount()`, which returns the current value of `count`, which is 2. The `count` variable is private—it can\'t be accessed directly from outside the closure, only through the provided methods. This encapsulation pattern is commonly used in JavaScript to create private state, similar to how other languages use private class fields."},{"id":198,"question":"What will this code output?","code":"const x = 10;\\nfunction foo() {\\n  console.log(x);\\n  var x = 20;\\n}\\nfoo();","options":["10","20","undefined","ReferenceError"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"This code will output `undefined`. This example demonstrates variable hoisting and shadowing within function scope. Even though there\'s a global `const x = 10`, inside the function `foo`, the local declaration `var x = 20` is hoisted. This means the variable declaration (but not its assignment) is moved to the top of the function scope. So within `foo`, the code behaves as if it were written:\\n```javascript\\nfunction foo() {\\n  var x; // hoisted declaration, initially undefined\\n  console.log(x); // logs undefined\\n  x = 20; // assignment happens here\\n}\\n```\\nThe local `x` shadows (takes precedence over) the global `x`, so the global `x` is inaccessible within `foo` once a local `x` is declared. This is why `console.log(x)` outputs `undefined`—it\'s accessing the hoisted but not yet assigned local variable, not the global constant. This behavior is specific to `var`; if `let` or `const` were used instead, we would get a ReferenceError due to the temporal dead zone (accessing a variable before its declaration)."},{"id":199,"question":"Which statement about the \'arguments\' object is true?","options":["It\'s an array containing all arguments passed to the function","It\'s only available in arrow functions","It\'s an array-like object that contains all arguments passed to the function","It\'s deprecated and should not be used in modern JavaScript"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The true statement is that the `arguments` object is an array-like object that contains all arguments passed to the function. It\'s available inside all functions except arrow functions. While `arguments` resembles an array (it has indexed elements and a length property), it\'s not a true array and lacks array methods like `map` and `filter`. To use array methods on `arguments`, you need to convert it first, typically with `Array.from(arguments)` or `[...arguments]` in modern JavaScript. The `arguments` object is useful for handling variable numbers of arguments, but in modern JavaScript, it\'s often replaced by the rest parameter syntax (`...args`), which creates a real array and is more explicit about a function\'s variadic nature. Despite some suggestions to avoid it, the `arguments` object isn\'t deprecated—it\'s still part of the language specification, though rest parameters offer a cleaner alternative in most cases."},{"id":200,"question":"What\'s the output of this code?","code":"function foo() {\\n  return bar();\\n  function bar() {\\n    return \'bar\';\\n  }\\n}\\nconsole.log(foo());","options":["undefined","\'bar\'","ReferenceError: bar is not defined","SyntaxError: code after return statement"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output of this code is `\'bar\'`. This demonstrates function declaration hoisting in JavaScript. Even though the function `bar` is declared after the `return` statement, function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that `bar` is already defined and accessible when `return bar();` is executed. Functionally, the code behaves as if it were written with `bar` defined before it\'s used:\\n```javascript\\nfunction foo() {\\n  function bar() {\\n    return \'bar\';\\n  }\\n  return bar();\\n}\\n```\\nThis is different from code after a `return` statement, which is indeed unreachable but doesn\'t cause a syntax error. The placement of the function declaration after the return doesn\'t matter—it\'s hoisted and fully available throughout the function body.

Function declarations (not expressions) are hoisted entirely with their implementation. This behavior is part of JavaScript\'s two-phase processing: first, the creation phase where declarations are processed and hoisted, and second, the execution phase where the code is run line by line.

During this TDZ, any attempt to access the variable will result in a ReferenceError. This behavior was introduced in ES6 (ES2015) with `let` and `const` to help catch potential bugs caused by accessing variables before they\'re declared. It enforces better coding practices by making the error explicit rather than returning the often-confusing `undefined` value that occurs with `var` declarations.

This differs from variable hoisting, where only the declaration is hoisted but not the assignment. When a function is declared using the function declaration syntax (`function myFunction() {}`), the entire function, including its name, parameters, and body, is hoisted to the top of its scope. This means you can call the function before it appears in your code. For example:\\n```javascript\\nmyFunction(); // This works!\\nfunction myFunction() {\\n  console.log(\'Hello world\');\\n}\\n```\\nHowever, this only applies to function declarations. Function expressions (like `var myFunction = function() {}`) follow variable hoisting rules: only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function assignment, so trying to call the function before the assignment would result in a TypeError. This distinction is important to understand when structuring JavaScript code, as it affects when functions become available for execution."},{"id":246,"question":"What will be the output of this code?","code":"function example() {\\n  console.log(a);\\n  var a = 5;\\n  console.log(a);\\n}\\n\\nexample();","options":["undefined, undefined","5, 5","undefined, 5","ReferenceError: Cannot access \'a\' before initialization"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The output will be `undefined, 5`. This demonstrates how variable hoisting works within a function scope. When the `example()` function is called, during the creation phase, the variable declaration `var a;` is hoisted to the top of the function, but the initialization `a = 5;` stays in its original position. So the code effectively runs as:\\n```javascript\\nfunction example() {\\n  var a; // a is declared but not yet initialized (value is undefined)\\n  console.log(a); // logs undefined\\n  a = 5; // a is assigned the value 5\\n  console.log(a); // logs 5\\n}\\n```\\nThis example illustrates how hoisting affects variable behavior within function scopes, not just at the global level. Each function creates its own execution context with its own variable environment, and hoisting occurs independently within each function scope. This behavior is consistent for all `var` declarations, regardless of the containing scope."},{"id":247,"question":"What will this code output?","code":"function foo() {\\n  return bar();\\n  function bar() {\\n    return \'Hello!\';\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nconsole.log(foo());","options":["undefined","\'Hello!\'","ReferenceError: bar is not defined","SyntaxError: code after return statement"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output will be `\'Hello!\'`. This example demonstrates function hoisting.

As a result, the code effectively runs as if it were written:\\n```javascript\\nfunction foo() {\\n  function bar() { // function declaration is hoisted\\n    return \'Hello!\';\\n  }\\n  return bar(); // bar is already defined and can be called\\n}\\n```\\nThis is why the function `bar()` can be called successfully before its definition in the source code. Note that this behavior only applies to function declarations (using the `function name() {}` syntax). Function expressions (like `var bar = function() {}`) would follow variable hoisting rules where only the variable declaration is hoisted but not the function assignment.

For example:\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  // TDZ for x starts here\\n  console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access \'x\' before initialization\\n  let x = 5; // TDZ ends for x\\n  console.log(x); // 5 (works fine)\\n}\\n```\\nThe TDZ was introduced with the `let` and `const` declarations in ES6 to help catch programming errors. Unlike variables declared with `var` (which are initialized with `undefined` when hoisted), `let` and `const` variables remain uninitialized within the TDZ.

When using `const` or `let`, the variable is hoisted but remains in a temporal dead zone until its declaration is reached during execution. Unlike with `var`, which would be initialized as `undefined` when hoisted, accessing a `const` or `let` variable before its declaration results in a ReferenceError. Additionally, this example uses a function expression assigned to a variable, not a function declaration. With function declarations (`function square(n) {...}`), the entire function would be hoisted and could be called before its declaration in the code. But with function expressions assigned to variables, the rules of variable hoisting apply based on whether `var`, `let`, or `const` is used. In this case, using `const` means that `square` cannot be accessed before its declaration line, resulting in the ReferenceError."},{"id":250,"question":"What is the JavaScript execution context?","options":["The browser or environment in which JavaScript runs","The specific JavaScript engine implementation being used","The environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed","The function that contains the currently executing code"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The JavaScript execution context is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. It\'s a conceptual container that tracks the execution of code, manages variables, and defines the value of `this`. Every time JavaScript code runs, it runs inside an execution context. There are three types of execution contexts:\\n\\n1. Global Execution Context: Created when a JavaScript script starts running - it\'s the default context where code that isn\'t inside any function is executed.\\n\\n2. Function Execution Context: Created whenever a function is called - each function call creates its own execution context.\\n\\n3. Eval Execution Context: Created when code is executed inside an `eval()` function.\\n\\nEach execution context has two phases: the Creation Phase and the Execution Phase. During the Creation Phase, the JavaScript engine sets up the Variable Environment, creates the scope chain, and determines the value of `this`. During the Execution Phase, the code is executed line by line. Understanding execution contexts is fundamental to understanding JavaScript\'s behavior regarding variables, scope, and the `this` keyword."},{"id":251,"question":"What happens during the creation phase of an execution context?","options":["JavaScript code is executed line by line","Variables are assigned their values and functions are executed","Memory is allocated for variables and the scope chain is created","External scripts and modules are loaded"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"During the creation phase of an execution context, memory is allocated for variables and the scope chain is created. This phase occurs before code execution and involves several specific steps:\\n\\n1. Creation of the Variable Environment: JavaScript allocates memory for variables and functions declared in the code. Function declarations are stored in their entirety, while variables declared with `var` are initialized with the value `undefined`. Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized (remaining in the temporal dead zone).\\n\\n2. Creation of the Scope Chain: References to outer environments are established, creating the scope chain that determines variable access.\\n\\n3. Determining the value of `this`: The value of the `this` keyword is determined based on how the function is called.\\n\\nOnly after this creation phase is complete does JavaScript move to the execution phase, where code is actually executed line by line, and variables receive their assigned values. This two-phase process explains behaviors like hoisting, where variables and functions can be accessed before their declarations appear in the code."},{"id":252,"question":"What will this code output?","code":"var x = 1;\\nfunction foo() {\\n  console.log(x);\\n  var x = 2;\\n}\\nfoo();","options":["1","2","undefined","ReferenceError"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The output will be `undefined`. This example demonstrates variable shadowing and hoisting within function scopes. When the function `foo()` is called, it creates its own execution context. During the creation phase of this context, the variable declaration `var x;` is hoisted to the top of the function, creating a new variable `x` local to the function that shadows the global `x`. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization `x = 2`. So when `console.log(x)` executes, it refers to the local `x` which exists but is `undefined` at that point. The code effectively runs as:\\n```javascript\\nvar x = 1; // global x\\nfunction foo() {\\n  var x; // local x is hoisted, initialized as undefined\\n  console.log(x); // logs undefined (local x, not global x)\\n  x = 2; // local x is assigned 2\\n}\\nfoo();\\n```\\nThis behavior shows how function scopes create their own variable environments and how variable declarations within a function shadow variables with the same name from outer scopes."},{"id":253,"question":"What is the scope chain in JavaScript?","options":["A linked list of function calls in the call stack","A list of all global variables accessible to a script","A hierarchical chain of nested scopes that determines variable access","The order in which JavaScript files are loaded and executed"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The scope chain in JavaScript is a hierarchical chain of nested scopes that determines variable access. When JavaScript tries to resolve a variable reference, it first looks in the current scope (local execution context). If it doesn\'t find the variable there, it looks in the next outer scope, and continues up the chain until it either finds the variable or reaches the global scope. If the variable isn\'t found in the global scope, a ReferenceError is thrown.\\n\\nThe scope chain is created during the creation phase of an execution context and is based on lexical scoping - where functions are defined in the code, not where they\'re called from. Each execution context has a reference to its outer environment, forming links in the chain.\\n\\nFor example:\\n```javascript\\nconst global = \'global\';\\nfunction outer() {\\n  const outerVar = \'outer\';\\n  function inner() {\\n    const innerVar = \'inner\';\\n    console.log(innerVar, outerVar, global); // Can access all three\\n  }\\n  inner();\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen `inner()` executes, its scope chain includes its own scope, `outer()`\'s scope, and the global scope, allowing it to access variables from all three scopes.

This example demonstrates the interaction between function closures, variable scope, and the asynchronous nature of `setTimeout`. The key points to understand are:\\n\\n1. The variable `i` is declared with `var`, which has function scope (not block scope).\\n2. The loop runs quickly, creating three `setTimeout` calls with callbacks that will execute after 1 second.\\n3. By the time these callbacks execute, the loop has already completed and `i` has the value `3` (the value that terminated the loop condition `i < 3`).\\n4. All three callbacks reference the same `i` variable in their closure, and by the time they execute, that variable\'s value is `3`.\\n\\nThis is a common gotcha in JavaScript. To get the expected behavior of logging `0, 1, 2`, you would need to either:\\n\\n1. Use `let` instead of `var` to create a block-scoped variable for each iteration: `for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++)`\\n2. Create a new function scope for each iteration to capture the current value of `i`: `for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) { (function(j) { setTimeout(function() { console.log(j); }, 1000); })(i); }`\\n\\nThis example illustrates the importance of understanding variable scope and closures in JavaScript, especially when working with asynchronous code."},{"id":255,"question":"What is a closure in JavaScript?","options":["A way to close or terminate a function execution","A function that has completed execution and been removed from the call stack","A function bundled with references to its surrounding lexical environment","A technique for hiding global variables from other scripts"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"A closure in JavaScript is a function bundled with references to its surrounding lexical environment (the variables available at the location where the function was declared). In simpler terms, a closure gives you access to an outer function\'s scope from an inner function, even after the outer function has finished executing.\\n\\nClosures are created every time a function is created in JavaScript. The inner function maintains references to the variables from its outer function\'s scope, allowing it to access those variables even after the outer function has returned.\\n\\nFor example:\\n```javascript\\nfunction createCounter() {\\n  let count = 0; // This variable is enclosed in the returned function\'s closure\\n  return function() {\\n    count++; // This function can access and modify the count variable\\n    return count;\\n  };\\n}\\n\\nconst counter = createCounter();\\nconsole.log(counter()); // 1\\nconsole.log(counter()); // 2\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the inner function maintains access to the `count` variable even after `createCounter` has finished executing. The `count` variable is private to the returned function - it can\'t be accessed directly from outside, only through the function calls. This enables powerful patterns like data encapsulation, private variables, function factories, and maintaining state between function calls.

Each call to `createCounter()` returns a new function that has access to its own enclosed `count` variable through closure.\\n\\n3. `counter1` and `counter2` are different functions, each with their own separate closure over different instances of the `count` variable.\\n\\n4. When `counter1()` is called the first time, it increments its enclosed `count` from 0 to 1 and logs 1.\\n\\n5.

This code demonstrates how closures maintain references to variables in their outer lexical environment, not just copies of their values. Here\'s what happens:\\n\\n1. The `outer()` function is called and creates a local variable `x` with value 10.\\n2. It defines an inner function that accesses both its own local variable `y` and the outer variable `x`.\\n3. The inner function is returned and assigned to `closureFn`.\\n4. Even though `outer()` has finished executing, the `inner()` function maintains access to the environment where it was created, including the variable `x`.\\n5. When `closureFn()` is called the first time, it accesses `x` (which is 10) and `y` (which is 5), logs their sum (15), and increments `x` to 11.\\n6. When `closureFn()` is called the second time, it creates a new `y` with value 5, but accesses the same `x` which is now 11, logs their sum (16), and increments `x` to 12.\\n\\nThis demonstrates that the closure maintains a reference to the variable `x` itself, not just its value at the time of closure creation.

When you assign a value to a variable that hasn\'t been formally declared, JavaScript automatically creates that variable in the global scope, regardless of where the assignment happens.

That\'s why \'strict mode\' was introduced - when you enable strict mode by adding `\'use strict\';` at the top of your script or function, assigning to undeclared variables will throw a ReferenceError instead:\\n\\n```javascript\\n\'use strict\';\\nfunction test() {\\n  x = 10; // ReferenceError: x is not defined\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIt\'s always recommended to explicitly declare variables using var, let, or const to clearly indicate their intended scope and avoid potential issues."},{"id":260,"question":"What is the execution context stack (call stack) in JavaScript?","options":["A list of all available variables in the current scope","A mechanism for storing function parameters and return values","A data structure that tracks the execution of functions in a LIFO order","A way to organize global variables in memory"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The execution context stack, commonly known as the call stack, is a data structure that tracks the execution of functions in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. It works as follows:\\n\\n1. When JavaScript starts executing code, it creates a global execution context and pushes it onto the stack.\\n\\n2. When a function is called, a new execution context is created for that function and pushed onto the top of the stack.\\n\\n3. When the current function completes, its execution context is popped off the stack, and control returns to the context below it.\\n\\n4. This process continues until the stack is empty.\\n\\nFor example, consider this code:\\n```javascript\\nfunction first() {\\n  console.log(\'First function\');\\n  second();\\n  console.log(\'Back to first\');\\n}\\n\\nfunction second() {\\n  console.log(\'Second function\');\\n}\\n\\nfirst();\\n```\\n\\nHere\'s how the call stack would change:\\n1.

This is true in non-strict mode.\\n\\nHowever, it\'s important to note that if strict mode is enabled (`\'use strict\';`), the behavior would be different - `this` would be `undefined` instead of the global object:\\n\\n```javascript\\n\'use strict\';\\nfunction example() {\\n  console.log(this); // undefined\\n}\\n\\nexample();\\n```\\n\\nThis behavior of `this` is one of the most confusing aspects of JavaScript for many developers.

When \'counter\' is called, it accesses the \'count\' variable in its closure scope, increments it, and returns the new value. Each call to \'counter()\' increases \'count\' by 1, resulting in the sequence 1, 2, 3.

Prior to ES6 modules and block-scoped variables (let/const), this was the primary way to prevent variables from leaking into the global scope. By enclosing all your code in an IIFE, any variables declared inside it remain private to that function scope. This was a common practice in larger JavaScript applications and libraries, where preventing name collisions was crucial.

This follows the standard rules for \'this\' in JavaScript: when a function is called without any context (not as a method, not with call/apply/bind), \'this\' defaults to the global object in non-strict mode. This behavior can sometimes be surprising, and it\'s one of the reasons why many developers prefer to use strict mode (\'use strict\'), where \'this\' would be undefined in this case.

This demonstrates variable shadowing and scope isolation. Inside the IIFE, a new \'value\' variable is declared with \'var\', which shadows (hides) the global \'value\' variable. When console.log(value) is called inside the IIFE, it refers to this local variable and prints \'local\'. After the IIFE completes, the second console.log(value) executes in the global scope, where \'value\' is still \'global\', so it prints \'global\'. This example shows how IIFEs create their own variable scope, preventing local variables from affecting variables in the outer scope even if they have the same name.

In the provided example, JavaScript might interpret \'var a = 5\' as a function that\'s being called with the function expression as an argument, resulting in an error like \'number is not a function\'. This is because JavaScript has automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), but it doesn\'t always work as expected. This is why many style guides recommend always using semicolons in JavaScript, or if you prefer to omit them, being very careful with expressions that start with \'(\', \'[\', or \'/\', which can cause parsing issues. A common practice is to start IIFEs with a semicolon (;(function(){})()), especially in concatenated code, to prevent such errors."},{"id":297,"question":"How can you make variables inside one IIFE accessible to another IIFE?","options":["You can\'t, IIFEs create completely isolated scopes","By declaring the variables in the global scope","By returning the variables and assigning them to a shared scope variable","By using the \'export\' keyword"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"You can make variables inside one IIFE accessible to another IIFE by returning the variables and assigning them to a shared scope variable. While IIFEs do create their own isolated scope, they can communicate with the outer scope by returning values or by modifying variables that both IIFEs can access. A common pattern is to have both IIFEs assign their public interfaces to properties of the same object, creating a namespace. For example:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar namespace = {};\\n\\n// First IIFE adds to namespace\\n(function() {\\n  var privateVar = \'private\';\\n  namespace.method1 = function() { return privateVar; };\\n})();\\n\\n// Second IIFE can use what first one exposed\\n(function() {\\n  namespace.method2 = function() { return namespace.method1() + \' accessed\'; };\\n})();\\n```\\n\\nThis is one way modules were implemented before ES6 modules."},{"id":298,"question":"What is a good use case for an IIFE with async/await?","options":["IIFEs cannot be used with async/await","To perform asynchronous initialization code at the top level of a script","To prevent async functions from executing","To make all code execute synchronously"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"A good use case for an IIFE with async/await is to perform asynchronous initialization code at the top level of a script. Before top-level await was supported in JavaScript modules, wrapping asynchronous code in an async IIFE was the primary way to use await outside of an async function. For example:\\n\\n```javascript\\n(async function() {\\n  try {\\n    const data = await fetch(\'/api/data\');\\n    const result = await data.json();\\n    console.log(result);\\n    // Initialize application with result\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    console.error(\'Failed to initialize:\', error);\\n  }\\n})();\\n```\\n\\nThis pattern allows you to write clean, sequential-looking code for asynchronous operations without needing to create and name a separate function.

This code demonstrates an IIFE using arrow function syntax rather than the traditional function syntax. Just like with regular function expressions, an arrow function can be wrapped in parentheses to create an expression, and then immediately invoked with another set of parentheses. In this case, the arrow function sets x to 10, multiplies it by 2, and returns the result. The return value (20) is then assigned to the \'result\' constant. This example shows that IIFEs aren\'t limited to traditional function expressions; they can be created with any function expression syntax, including arrow functions. Arrow functions in IIFEs have the additional characteristic that they don\'t bind their own \'this\' value but inherit it from the surrounding scope."},{"id":300,"question":"What\'s the difference between using an IIFE and a block statement with let/const for creating a private scope?","code":"// Approach 1: IIFE\\n(function() {\\n  const x = 10;\\n  console.log(x);\\n})();\\n\\n// Approach 2: Block with let/const\\n{\\n  const x = 10;\\n  console.log(x);\\n}","options":["There is no difference; they both create a private scope","The IIFE creates a function scope while the block creates a block scope, but they function similarly for let/const","The block approach doesn\'t work; variables will still leak to the outer scope","The IIFE approach is always more efficient"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The main difference is that the IIFE creates a function scope while the block creates a block scope, but they function similarly for let/const. With the introduction of let and const in ES6, which have block scope, a simple block statement can now be used to create a private scope for variables without needing an IIFE. Both approaches effectively prevent the variables inside them from leaking to the outer scope. The block approach is more concise, but the IIFE approach has additional benefits: it can return values, accept parameters, and create closures that persist after the IIFE completes. The IIFE approach was also the only option before ES6. The choice between them depends on your specific needs - use a block for simple scoping, and an IIFE when you need function features like return values or closures."},{"id":301,"question":"What will the following code output?","code":"for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\\n  setTimeout(function() {\\n    console.log(i);\\n  }, 1000);\\n}\\n\\n// Modified version with IIFE\\nfor (var j = 0; j < 3; j++) {\\n  (function(index) {\\n    setTimeout(function() {\\n      console.log(index);\\n    }, 1000);\\n  })(j);\\n}","options":["0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2","3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 2","0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3","3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output will be 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 2. This example demonstrates a classic closure pitfall and how IIFEs can solve it. In the first loop, by the time the setTimeout callbacks execute (after 1 second), the loop has already completed and the variable i has reached the value 3. Since all three callbacks reference the same variable i through closure, they all log 3. In the second loop, each iteration creates an IIFE that captures the current value of j (as the parameter \'index\') and creates a new closure for each timeout function. This way, each callback has its own copy of the loop counter value at the time the IIFE was called, resulting in the output 0, 1, 2. This is a common pattern used before let/const introduced block scoping, which would also solve this problem (using \'let j\' instead of \'var j\').

IIFEs don\'t inherently make code run faster; in fact, function calls add a small overhead. The main purposes of IIFEs are: 1) Creating private variables and functions that don\'t pollute the global namespace, 2) Isolating variable declarations to prevent naming conflicts, 3) Creating closures that capture the current state for later use (especially in async operations), and 4) Implementing module patterns for better code organization. While there might be specific scenarios where using an IIFE leads to more optimized code patterns, performance improvement is generally not the primary motivation for using this pattern. IIFEs are more about code organization, encapsulation, and maintaining clean namespaces."},{"id":303,"question":"What is the relationship between IIFEs and the module pattern in JavaScript?","options":["They are unrelated concepts","IIFEs are deprecated and replaced by the module pattern","The module pattern is a specific application of IIFEs to create encapsulated modules with private and public members","IIFEs can only be used inside ES6 modules"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The module pattern is a specific application of IIFEs to create encapsulated modules with private and public members. The classic JavaScript module pattern uses an IIFE that returns an object containing public methods and properties, while keeping private variables and functions hidden inside the closure. This pattern was extremely important in pre-ES6 JavaScript when there was no native module system. It allowed developers to create reusable, encapsulated code blocks with clear interfaces and hidden implementation details. The pattern looks something like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nvar myModule = (function() {\\n  // Private members\\n  var privateVar = \'private\';\\n  function privateMethod() { return privateVar; }\\n  \\n  // Public interface\\n  return {\\n    publicVar: \'public\',\\n    publicMethod: function() { return privateMethod(); }\\n  };\\n})();\\n```\\n\\nWhile ES6 modules have largely replaced this pattern for new code, understanding the module pattern is still valuable for working with legacy code and understanding JavaScript\'s evolution."},{"id":304,"question":"How would you modify the \'this\' value inside an IIFE?","options":["It\'s not possible to modify \'this\' inside an IIFE","By using the \'bind\', \'call\', or \'apply\' methods","By using the \'with\' statement","By using arrow function syntax for the IIFE"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"You can modify the \'this\' value inside an IIFE by using the \'bind\', \'call\', or \'apply\' methods. For example:\\n\\n```javascript\\n(function() {\\n  console.log(this);\\n}).call(someObject); // \'this\' will be \'someObject\'\\n```\\n\\nOr with apply:\\n```javascript\\n(function() {\\n  console.log(this);\\n}).apply(someObject); // \'this\' will be \'someObject\'\\n```\\n\\nOr with bind (though this creates a new function that needs to be invoked):\\n```javascript\\n(function() {\\n  console.log(this);\\n}).bind(someObject)(); // \'this\' will be \'someObject\'\\n```\\n\\nThis technique is useful when you need the code inside the IIFE to run in a specific context, such as when working with objects or constructing prototype methods. It\'s worth noting that if you use an arrow function for your IIFE, you can\'t modify its \'this\' value using these methods, as arrow functions lexically bind \'this\'."},{"id":305,"question":"What will the following nested IIFE code output?","code":"var result = (function outer() {\\n  var x = 10;\\n  return (function inner() {\\n    var y = 20;\\n    return x + y;\\n  })();\\n})();\\n\\nconsole.log(result);","options":["10","20","30","Error: x is not defined"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The output will be 30. This code demonstrates nested IIFEs with closure. The outer IIFE defines a variable x with a value of 10. It then defines and immediately invokes an inner IIFE. This inner function creates its own variable y with a value of 20, and returns x + y. Because of closure, the inner function has access to variables from its own scope as well as from the enclosing (outer) function scope, so it can access x. The outer IIFE returns the result of the inner IIFE (which is 30), and this value is assigned to the variable \'result\'. This pattern of nested IIFEs can be used to create more complex scoping arrangements and data encapsulation, though it\'s important to balance this with code readability."},{"id":306,"question":"What is the output of this IIFE that uses the \'arguments\' object?","code":"var result = (function() {\\n  return Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).map(function(x) {\\n    return x * 2;\\n  });\\n})(1, 2, 3);\\n\\nconsole.log(result);","options":["[1, 2, 3]","[2, 4, 6]","[]","Error"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output will be [2, 4, 6]. This code demonstrates an IIFE that accepts arguments and processes them. When the IIFE is invoked with (1, 2, 3), these values are passed as arguments to the function. Inside the function, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) converts the arguments object into a regular array. Then, the map method is called on this array, creating a new array where each element is doubled. The resulting array [2, 4, 6] is returned from the IIFE and assigned to \'result\'.

It starts with i equal to 10 and decrements i after each iteration, continuing as long as i is greater than or equal to 1.

This demonstrates block scoping with the let keyword. The first let x = 1 creates a variable x in the outer scope. Inside the if block, let x = 2 creates a new variable x in the inner scope, which shadows (hides) the outer x. The console.log(x) inside the if block refers to the inner x, which is 2. After the if block ends, the inner x goes out of scope, and the console.log(x) refers to the outer x, which is still 1. This is why using let (or const) for variable declarations is often safer than var, which doesn\'t have block scope."},{"id":73,"question":"Which of the following is a valid way to skip iterations in a JavaScript loop when a condition is met?","options":["skip;","continue;","pass;","next;"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The valid way to skip iterations in a JavaScript loop when a condition is met is to use the continue; statement. When encountered in a loop, continue skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration. For example, for(let i=0; i<5; i++) { if(i === 2) continue; console.log(i); } will log 0, 1, 3, and 4, but skip 2.

This means you can\'t exit early from a forEach() loop or skip specific iterations using standard flow control. The forEach() method is also more declarative and often more readable for simple array iterations, but it\'s limited to arrays (and array-like objects), whereas a for loop can iterate over any kind of data.

It\'s a concise and powerful way to unpack values from data structures. For example, with array destructuring, you can write `const [first, second] = [1, 2]` to assign 1 to first and 2 to second. With object destructuring, you can write `const { name, age } = person` to extract specific properties. This makes your code cleaner and more readable by reducing the need for repetitive property access. Destructuring also works in function parameters, return values, and loop constructs, making it a versatile feature throughout JavaScript code."},{"id":162,"question":"Which of the following correctly destructures the first and third elements of an array?","options":["const [first, third] = array;","const {0: first, 2: third} = array;","const [first, , third] = array;","const first = array[0], third = array[2];"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The correct way to destructure the first and third elements of an array is `const [first, , third] = array;`. This syntax uses a comma with nothing between to skip the second element of the array. This is called \'ignoring\' or \'skipping\' elements in destructuring. The first element of the array is assigned to the variable `first`, the second element is skipped (notice the empty space between commas), and the third element is assigned to the variable `third`. This approach is more concise than traditional indexing when you only need specific elements from an array.

This code demonstrates default values in object destructuring. When you provide a default value using the assignment operator (=) in the destructuring pattern, that value is used if the property is undefined or doesn\'t exist in the source object. In this case, the object being destructured has a `name` property but no `age` property. Since `age` isn\'t found in the source object, the default value of 25 is assigned to the `age` variable. This feature is particularly useful when working with APIs or user inputs where certain properties might be optional. It allows you to provide fallback values and avoid having to check for undefined values later in your code. Default values are only applied when the property is missing or undefined, not for other falsy values like null, 0, or an empty string."},{"id":164,"question":"What is the spread operator in JavaScript?","options":["An operator that divides arrays into smaller chunks","A syntax for collecting multiple elements into a single variable","A syntax that expands iterables into individual elements","An operator that sorts and spreads array elements in ascending order"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The spread operator (`...`) in JavaScript is a syntax that expands iterables (like arrays, strings, or objects) into individual elements. For arrays, it spreads the array into individual elements. For example, `Math.max(...[1, 2, 3])` is equivalent to `Math.max(1, 2, 3)`. For objects, it copies enumerable properties from one object to another. For example, `{...obj1, ...obj2}` creates a new object with properties from both obj1 and obj2. The spread operator was introduced in ES6 for arrays and expanded to objects in ES2018. It\'s commonly used for creating copies of arrays or objects, combining multiple arrays or objects, passing array elements as function arguments, and converting iterables like NodeLists to arrays. Unlike the rest parameter (which also uses `...` syntax), the spread operator is used in function calls or array/object literals rather than in declarations."},{"id":165,"question":"How do you use the spread operator to create a shallow copy of an array?","options":["const copy = [array];","const copy = [...array];","const copy = array.copy();","const copy = Array.from(array);"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"To create a shallow copy of an array using the spread operator, you write `const copy = [...array];`. This syntax creates a new array and expands all elements of the original array into it. It\'s a concise and popular way to clone arrays in modern JavaScript. It\'s important to note that this creates a shallow copy, meaning that if the array contains objects or nested arrays, those will still be references to the original objects (not deep copies). A shallow copy is sufficient for arrays of primitive values (numbers, strings, booleans). The spread operator provides a clean alternative to other array copying methods like `Array.from(array)`, `array.slice()`, or `[].concat(array)`. If you need a deep copy for nested data structures, you would need to use more complex approaches like `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(array))` (with limitations) or a dedicated deep-cloning library."},{"id":166,"question":"What will be logged? const obj = {a: 1, b: 2}; const {a, ...rest} = obj; console.log(rest);","options":["{a: 1, b: 2}","{b: 2}","[b: 2]","2"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The code will log `{b: 2}`. This demonstrates the rest pattern in object destructuring. The syntax `...rest` collects all remaining properties (those not explicitly destructured) into a new object. In this case, the property `a` is extracted into its own variable, and all other properties (just `b` in this example) are collected into the `rest` object. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to extract some specific properties while keeping the rest of the object intact. It\'s often used in scenarios like removing certain properties before passing an object to another function, or when implementing functions that accept specific options but pass through any additional options to another component. The rest pattern must be the last element in a destructuring assignment, and there can only be one rest element."},{"id":167,"question":"What is the difference between the spread operator and the rest parameter in JavaScript?","options":["They are the same thing, just used in different contexts","Spread expands elements, while rest collects them into an array","Spread is used with objects, while rest is used with arrays","Spread is ES6, while rest was introduced in ES7"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The key difference is that the spread operator expands elements, while the rest parameter collects them into an array. Though they both use the same `...` syntax, they serve opposite purposes. The spread operator is used in function calls, array literals, or object literals to expand elements from an iterable (like an array) or properties from an object. For example: `fn(...array)` or `[1, 2, ...array]`. The rest parameter is used in function parameters or destructuring assignments to collect multiple elements into a single array. For example: `function fn(...args) {}` or `const [first, ...others] = array;`. You can think of spread as unpacking a collection, while rest is packing multiple items into a collection. Both were introduced in ES6, but with different purposes and in different contexts.

This elegant one-liner leverages array destructuring assignment to perform the swap. The right side `[b, a]` creates a new array with the values in swapped order, and the left side destructures these values back into the original variables. This technique is more readable and less error-prone than traditional approaches that use a temporary variable (`let temp = a; a = b; b = temp;`) or bitwise operations. It works because the right-hand side array is evaluated first, capturing the current values of `a` and `b`, and then the destructuring assignment happens as a separate step. This pattern is commonly used in modern JavaScript and is especially useful in algorithms like sorting where variable swapping is frequent."},{"id":169,"question":"What happens when you destructure a property that doesn\'t exist on the object?","options":["It throws an error","It assigns \'null\' to the variable","It assigns \'undefined\' to the variable","It skips that assignment"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"When you destructure a property that doesn\'t exist on the object, the variable is assigned the value `undefined`. This is consistent with how JavaScript handles property access: attempting to access a non-existent property on an object returns `undefined`. For example, in `const { nonExistent } = { existing: 42 };`, the variable `nonExistent` will be `undefined`. This behavior allows for flexible destructuring patterns where you might not be certain if all properties exist. To handle this gracefully, you can provide default values in the destructuring pattern: `const { nonExistent = \'default\' } = obj;`. With a default value specified, if the property doesn\'t exist or is `undefined`, the variable will be assigned the default value instead. This default value assignment only applies to `undefined` properties, not to other falsy values like `null`, empty strings, or zero."},{"id":170,"question":"Which of the following is a valid use of nested destructuring?","options":["const [a, [b, c]] = [1, [2, 3]];","const {a, {b, c}} = {a: 1, {b: 2, c: 3}};","const {a, b: {c, d}} = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4};","const {a, b: {c, d}} = {a: 1, b: {c: 2, d: 3}};"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"The valid use of nested destructuring is `const {a, b: {c, d}} = {a: 1, b: {c: 2, d: 3}};`. This syntax correctly destructures a nested object, extracting the property `a` from the top level, and properties `c` and `d` from the nested object at property `b`. After this destructuring, the variables would be: `a = 1`, `c = 2`, and `d = 3` (note that there\'s no variable named `b` created). Nested destructuring is useful when working with complex data structures like API responses or configuration objects. It allows you to extract deeply nested values in a single statement. Option 1 is valid for arrays but not marked as correct here. Option 2 has invalid object syntax. Option 3 is incorrect because the structure doesn\'t match the data (it tries to destructure properties from `b` as if it were an object, but `b` is just a number in this example)."},{"id":171,"question":"What does the following code do? function fn({name, age}) { console.log(name, age); }","options":["Creates a function that logs name and age properties of any object passed to it","Creates a function that expects an object with only name and age properties","Creates a function that accepts parameters called name and age","Creates a function that logs undefined twice"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"This code creates a function that logs name and age properties of any object passed to it. It uses object destructuring in the function parameter, which extracts the `name` and `age` properties from the object provided as an argument. For example, calling `fn({name: \'Alice\', age: 30, job: \'Developer\'})` would log `\'Alice\' 30` to the console. The function doesn\'t require the object to have only these properties—any additional properties will simply be ignored in the destructuring. If a property doesn\'t exist, its value will be `undefined`. This pattern is common in modern JavaScript, especially in React components and other frameworks, as it makes the function\'s expected input more explicit and reduces the need for repetitive property access inside the function body. It also allows for default values: `function fn({name = \'Unknown\', age = 0} = {})` would provide defaults if properties are missing or if no object is passed at all."},{"id":172,"question":"How can you use the spread operator to merge two objects?","options":["const merged = {...obj1, ...obj2};","const merged = Object.merge(obj1, obj2);","const merged = [obj1, obj2].flatten();","const merged = obj1 + obj2;"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"You can use the spread operator to merge two objects by writing `const merged = {...obj1, ...obj2};`. This syntax creates a new object and copies all enumerable properties from both source objects into it. If both objects have properties with the same key, the value from the second object (obj2) will overwrite the value from the first (obj1). This is because properties are applied in order from left to right. This object spread syntax was introduced in ES2018 (though it was available earlier in many environments via transpilers). It provides a concise alternative to `Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2)`. Both methods create a shallow copy—if properties contain nested objects, those will still be references to the original objects. This pattern is commonly used in state management (like Redux reducers), when updating configuration objects, or when creating new objects based on existing ones with some modifications."},{"id":173,"question":"What is the output of this code? const [a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]; console.log(rest);","options":["[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]","[30, 40, 50]","[40, 50]","30"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output is `[30, 40, 50]`. This code demonstrates the rest pattern in array destructuring. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the first two elements of the array (10 and 20 respectively), and the rest pattern `...rest` collects all remaining elements into a new array called `rest`. In this case, that includes the elements at index 2 and beyond: 30, 40, and 50. The rest pattern is useful when you want to extract some specific elements from the beginning of an array while keeping the remaining elements together as an array. It must be the last element in the destructuring pattern, and there can only be one rest element. This pattern works well with functions that accept a variable number of arguments or when processing arrays where the first few elements have special meaning and the rest should be handled collectively."},{"id":174,"question":"How could you use destructuring to extract the first element of an array and assign it to a variable called \'head\'?","options":["const head = array[0];","const {0: head} = array;","const [head] = array;","const {head} = array;"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"You can use array destructuring to extract the first element of an array and assign it to a variable called \'head\' by writing `const [head] = array;`. This concise syntax destructures the array and takes only the first element. It\'s equivalent to `const head = array[0];` but uses the more modern destructuring syntax. When you provide fewer variables in the destructuring pattern than there are elements in the array, JavaScript only assigns the elements that have corresponding variables in the pattern. Any additional elements in the array are simply ignored in this destructuring operation. This approach is particularly useful in functional programming patterns, like when implementing recursive functions where you often need to separate the first element (head) from the rest of the array. Option 2 (`const {0: head} = array;`) is technically valid as it uses object destructuring with numeric keys, but it\'s much less common."},{"id":175,"question":"What will be the value of x and y after this code? let [x = 1, y = 2] = [undefined, null];","options":["x = undefined, y = null","x = 1, y = null","x = 1, y = 2","x = undefined, y = 2"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"After this code runs, the values will be `x = 1` and `y = null`. This demonstrates how default values work in destructuring assignments. Default values are only applied when the corresponding value in the array is `undefined` or when the position doesn\'t exist in the array. In this case, the first element of the array is `undefined`, so the default value of 1 is assigned to `x`. The second element is `null`, which is a defined value in JavaScript (not `undefined`), so the default value is not used and `null` is assigned to `y`. This behavior is important to understand: default values in destructuring are not applied for all falsy values—only for `undefined`. Values like `null`, `0`, empty strings, and `false` will override the default values because they are considered defined values. This allows for precise control over which values trigger defaults versus which ones are passed through as-is."},{"id":176,"question":"How can you use destructuring with renaming in objects?","options":["const { old as new } = obj;","const { old: new } = obj;","const { old -> new } = obj;","const { old | new } = obj;"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"You can use destructuring with renaming in objects using the syntax `const { old: new } = obj;`. This syntax extracts the property named \'old\' from the object and assigns its value to a new variable named \'new\'. This is useful when you want to extract a property but the property name isn\'t a suitable variable name, when it conflicts with existing variables, or when you want a more descriptive variable name. For example, `const { userId: id } = user;` would take the userId property from the user object and create a variable named id with its value. Note that this syntax can be a bit confusing because the colon looks similar to object literal syntax, but the meaning is reversed: in object literals, `{ key: value }` assigns a value to a key, while in destructuring, `{ key: newName }` assigns the value of the key to a variable named newName. You can also combine renaming with default values: `const { old: new = defaultValue } = obj;`."},{"id":177,"question":"What will this code output? function sum(...numbers) { return numbers.reduce((total, n) => total + n, 0); } console.log(sum(1, 2, 3));","options":["Error","6","[1, 2, 3]","undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"This code will output `6`. The function `sum` uses the rest parameter syntax (`...numbers`) to collect all arguments passed to the function into an array called `numbers`. In this case, when calling `sum(1, 2, 3)`, the `numbers` array becomes `[1, 2, 3]`. The function then uses the `reduce` method to add up all numbers in the array, starting with an initial total of 0. The calculation is 0 + 1 = 1, then 1 + 2 = 3, then 3 + 3 = 6. The rest parameter syntax is perfect for variadic functions (functions that can accept any number of arguments). Unlike the older `arguments` object, the rest parameter gives you a real array with all array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` available. The rest parameter must be the last parameter in a function definition, as it collects all remaining arguments."},{"id":178,"question":"What happens when you try to destructure a null or undefined value?","options":["It assigns null or undefined to all destructured variables","It assigns default values if provided, otherwise undefined","It silently fails and does nothing","It throws a TypeError"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"When you try to destructure a null or undefined value, JavaScript throws a TypeError. This happens because destructuring attempts to access properties on the value being destructured, and accessing properties on null or undefined results in an error. For example, `const { prop } = null;` would throw \\"TypeError: Cannot destructure property \'prop\' of \'null\' as it is null\\". To guard against this error, you can provide a default empty object or array in the destructuring assignment: `const { prop } = obj || {};` or `const [item] = arr || [];`. Alternatively, you can use optional chaining in newer JavaScript versions: `const { prop } = obj?.someObj || {};`. This behavior makes sense from a safety perspective—it\'s typically better to fail fast with an error than to silently create variables with undefined values, which could lead to harder-to-detect bugs later in your code."},{"id":179,"question":"Which of the following correctly uses destructuring to extract values from a nested array?","options":["const [a, [b, c]] = [1, [2, 3]];","const [a[b, c]] = [1, [2, 3]];","const [[a], [b, c]] = [[1], [2, 3]];","const [a, b[0], c[0]] = [1, [2], [3]];"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The correct way to use destructuring to extract values from a nested array is `const [a, [b, c]] = [1, [2, 3]];`. This syntax destructures the first element of the outer array into the variable `a` (which gets the value 1), and then destructures the second element (which is itself an array [2, 3]) using the nested pattern `[b, c]`. After this destructuring, `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 3`. Nested destructuring is useful when working with complex data structures like multi-dimensional arrays or JSON responses from APIs with nested arrays. The pattern on the left side of the assignment must match the structure of the data on the right side. You can nest destructuring patterns as deeply as needed to match your data structure, though extremely deep nesting can make code less readable. The other options contain syntax errors or don\'t match the structure of the given array."},{"id":180,"question":"How can you use object destructuring to extract a property that has a space in its name?","options":["const { property name } = obj;","const { \'property name\' } = obj;","const { property\\\\ name } = obj;","const { \'property name\': propertyName } = obj;"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"To use object destructuring to extract a property that has a space in its name, you write `const { \'property name\': propertyName } = obj;`. This syntax uses string literals for the property name and the colon syntax for renaming. Since JavaScript property names with spaces require bracket notation when accessed normally (e.g., `obj[\'property name\']`), destructuring them also requires special handling. The string literal inside the curly braces specifies the exact property name to extract, and the identifier after the colon specifies the variable name to assign it to. This approach works for any property names that aren\'t valid JavaScript identifiers, including those with spaces, hyphens, or starting with numbers. For example, to destructure properties like \'data-id\', \'@type\', or \'42answers\', you would use a similar pattern: `const { \'data-id\': dataId, \'@type\': type, \'42answers\': answers } = obj;`."}]}')},62244:function(e){"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"title":"JavaScript Basics","description":"Master the fundamental concepts of JavaScript with our comprehensive quiz collection covering variables, data types, operators, expressions, control flow, and loops."}')},66714:function(e){"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"id":2,"title":"Operators & Expressions","seoTitle":"JavaScript Operators and Expressions Quiz","description":"Test your knowledge of JavaScript operators, expressions, operator precedence, and type coercion with this comprehensive quiz.","questions":[{"id":26,"question":"Which of the following is NOT a JavaScript arithmetic operator?","options":["+","-","**","^"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"The caret (^) is not an arithmetic operator in JavaScript.

In this case, the boolean true is coerced to the number 1 for the addition operation."},{"id":29,"question":"What does the === operator do in JavaScript?","options":["Assigns a value to a variable","Compares values for equality, but not types","Compares both values and types for equality","Checks if a value is defined"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The === operator (strict equality operator) compares both values and types for equality. It returns true only if the operands have the same value and are of the same type. For example, 5 === 5 returns true, but 5 === \'5\' returns false because the types are different (number vs string). This is different from the == operator (loose equality), which performs type coercion before comparison, so 5 == \'5\' would return true."},{"id":30,"question":"What is the value of !!\'Hello\' in JavaScript?","options":["Hello","true","false","undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The expression !!\'Hello\' evaluates to true. The ! operator (logical NOT) converts its operand to a boolean and then negates it. A non-empty string like \'Hello\' is truthy, so !Hello evaluates to false. Then, !false evaluates to true. This double negation technique (!!x) is commonly used to convert any value to its boolean equivalent in JavaScript. It\'s a shorthand for Boolean(x)."},{"id":31,"question":"What is the result of 10 % 3 in JavaScript?","options":["1","3.33","3","0"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The expression 10 % 3 evaluates to 1. The % operator (modulus) returns the remainder of a division operation. When 10 is divided by 3, the quotient is 3 with a remainder of 1. The modulus operator is often used to check if a number is even or odd (n % 2 === 0 means n is even), to cycle through a range of values (like in circular arrays), or to ensure a value stays within a specific range."},{"id":32,"question":"Which operator is used for exponentiation in modern JavaScript?","options":["^","**","^^","Math.pow()"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The ** operator is used for exponentiation in modern JavaScript (introduced in ES2016/ES7). For example, 2 ** 3 evaluates to 8 (2 raised to the power of 3). Before ES2016, exponentiation had to be performed using the Math.pow() function: Math.pow(2, 3). The caret (^) operator is commonly used for exponentiation in many other programming languages but in JavaScript, it performs the bitwise XOR operation, not exponentiation."},{"id":33,"question":"What will typeof(typeof 42) return in JavaScript?","options":["number","undefined","string","object"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The expression typeof(typeof 42) returns \'string\'. The inner typeof 42 evaluates to \'number\' (a string), and then typeof \'number\' evaluates to \'string\'. This is because the typeof operator always returns a string representing the type of its operand. So, regardless of what value you apply typeof to, the result is always a string, which means applying typeof again will always result in \'string\'."},{"id":34,"question":"What is the result of \'5\' - 2 in JavaScript?","options":["52","3","\'52\'","\'3\'"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The expression \'5\' - 2 evaluates to 3 (a number). Unlike the + operator, which performs string concatenation if either operand is a string, the - operator always attempts to convert its operands to numbers. So, the string \'5\' is converted to the number 5, and then 5 - 2 equals 3. This illustrates an important difference in type coercion between + and - operators in JavaScript."},{"id":35,"question":"Which of these expressions evaluates to true in JavaScript?","options":["null == undefined","null === undefined","NaN === NaN","0 === -0"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The expression null == undefined evaluates to true. When using the loose equality operator (==), JavaScript performs type coercion, and null and undefined are considered equal to each other (but not to any other value). However, null === undefined is false because they have different types. NaN is never equal to anything, including itself, so NaN === NaN is false. And while 0 === -0 is true (which might be surprising), they\'re considered the same value in JavaScript despite having different representations."},{"id":36,"question":"What is the result of 5 && 0 in JavaScript?","options":["5","0","true","false"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The expression 5 && 0 evaluates to 0. In JavaScript, the logical AND operator (&&) returns the first falsy operand encountered, or the last operand if all are truthy. Since 5 is truthy, JavaScript evaluates the second operand 0, which is falsy, and returns 0 (not converted to a boolean). This differs from many other languages, where logical operators always return boolean values. In JavaScript, they return the actual operand value that determined the result."},{"id":37,"question":"What is the output of: console.log(1 + + \'2\');","options":["12","3","\'12\'","NaN"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output will be 3. The expression 1 + + \'2\' may look confusing due to the double + signs, but here\'s how it\'s evaluated: The second + is the unary plus operator, which converts its operand to a number. So + \'2\' evaluates to 2 (the number). Then, 1 + 2 equals 3. The unary plus is often used as a shorthand for Number() to convert strings to numbers, analogous to how unary minus (-) can negate a value."},{"id":38,"question":"Which operator is used for string concatenation in JavaScript?","options":["+","&","||","concat()"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The + operator is used for string concatenation in JavaScript. When one of the operands is a string, + performs concatenation instead of addition. For example, \'Hello \' + \'World\' results in \'Hello World\'. While the concat() method can also be used (as in \'Hello \'.concat(\'World\')), the + operator is more commonly used for string concatenation due to its simplicity and readability. Note that & is the bitwise AND operator and || is the logical OR operator in JavaScript."},{"id":39,"question":"What is the result of 5 || 0 in JavaScript?","options":["5","0","true","false"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The expression 5 || 0 evaluates to 5. In JavaScript, the logical OR operator (||) returns the first truthy operand encountered, or the last operand if all are falsy. Since 5 is truthy, it is returned immediately without evaluating the second operand. This behavior is leveraged in common JavaScript patterns like default parameter values before ES6: function foo(arg) { arg = arg || defaultValue; }. It\'s important to note that || returns the actual operand value, not a boolean."},{"id":40,"question":"What is the result of \'10\' == 10 in JavaScript?","options":["true","false","NaN","undefined"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The expression \'10\' == 10 evaluates to true. The loose equality operator (==) performs type coercion when comparing values of different types. In this case, the string \'10\' is converted to the number 10 before the comparison, resulting in 10 == 10, which is true. This behavior can sometimes lead to unexpected results and is one reason why the strict equality operator (===), which doesn\'t perform type coercion, is often recommended for equality comparisons in JavaScript."},{"id":41,"question":"What is the result of 4 > 5 > 3 in JavaScript?","options":["true","false","Error","undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The expression 4 > 5 > 3 evaluates to false. This is because comparison operators are evaluated from left to right. First, 4 > 5 is evaluated to false, since 4 is not greater than 5. Then, false > 3 is evaluated. In this context, false is coerced to the number 0, so the expression becomes 0 > 3, which is false. This example highlights the importance of understanding operator precedence and associativity in JavaScript, as well as being careful with chained comparison operators."},{"id":42,"question":"What is the result of +\'42\' in JavaScript?","options":["42","\'42\'","NaN","undefined"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The expression +\'42\' evaluates to the number 42. The unary plus operator (+) attempts to convert its operand to a number. When applied to a string that represents a valid number, it converts the string to the corresponding number. This is a concise way to convert strings to numbers, similar to using Number(\'42\'). If the string can\'t be converted to a valid number (e.g., +\'hello\'), the result would be NaN (Not a Number)."},{"id":43,"question":"What will the result of 10 / 0 be in JavaScript?","options":["0","Infinity","NaN","Error"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The expression 10 / 0 evaluates to Infinity in JavaScript. Unlike some programming languages that throw an error for division by zero, JavaScript has special numeric values to represent the result of such operations. Dividing a positive number by zero results in Infinity, dividing a negative number by zero results in -Infinity, and 0 / 0 results in NaN. These are all valid values in JavaScript\'s number type, and operations can continue after producing them, though they may lead to unexpected results."},{"id":44,"question":"What operator is used to determine the type of a variable in JavaScript?","options":["typeOf","instanceof","typeof","type"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The typeof operator is used to determine the type of a variable in JavaScript. It returns a string indicating the type of the operand. For example, typeof 42 returns \'number\', typeof \'hello\' returns \'string\', and typeof true returns \'boolean\'. However, typeof has some quirks: typeof null returns \'object\' (a historical bug), typeof NaN returns \'number\', and typeof for a function returns \'function\', even though functions are technically objects in JavaScript."},{"id":45,"question":"What is the result of 5 & 3 in JavaScript?","options":["8","2","1","15"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The expression 5 & 3 evaluates to 1. The & operator performs a bitwise AND operation on the operands. Converting 5 and 3 to binary, we get 101 & 011, which results in 001 (or 1 in decimal). A bitwise AND returns 1 for each bit position where both operands have a 1, otherwise it returns 0. Bitwise operators are less commonly used in everyday JavaScript, but they\'re useful for certain applications like flags, permissions, or low-level optimization."},{"id":46,"question":"What does the void operator do in JavaScript?","options":["Deletes a property from an object","Evaluates an expression and returns undefined","Creates an empty variable","Checks if a variable is undefined"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The void operator evaluates an expression and then returns undefined, regardless of the expression\'s result. For example, void(2 + 2) evaluates 2 + 2 (which is 4) but returns undefined. One common historical use was in HTML links to execute JavaScript without navigating: <a href=\\"javascript:void(0)\\" onclick=\\"myFunction()\\">Click me</a>. In modern JavaScript, it\'s less commonly used, but it can be a concise way to get undefined (void 0 is shorter than undefined and can\'t be overwritten)."},{"id":47,"question":"What is the result of \'5\' * \'3\' in JavaScript?","options":["15","\'15\'","\'53\'","NaN"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The expression \'5\' * \'3\' evaluates to 15 (a number). Unlike the + operator which can perform string concatenation, the * operator always attempts to convert its operands to numbers. So, the strings \'5\' and \'3\' are converted to the numbers 5 and 3, and then 5 * 3 equals 15. This is an example of JavaScript\'s implicit type coercion, where strings that represent valid numbers are automatically converted to numbers in a numeric context."},{"id":48,"question":"What does the expression ~~3.8 evaluate to in JavaScript?","options":["3","4","3.8","-3"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The expression ~~3.8 evaluates to 3. The ~ operator (bitwise NOT) first converts its operand to a 32-bit integer, then inverts all the bits, effectively calculating -(x+1) for a number x. When applied twice (~~x), it\'s equivalent to Math.floor(x) for positive numbers, but without the decimal part for negative numbers (actually equivalent to Math.trunc(x)). This bitwise trick is sometimes used as a faster alternative to Math.floor() or parseInt() when dealing with positive numbers."},{"id":49,"question":"What is the result of \'b\' + \'a\' + + \'a\' + \'a\' in JavaScript?","options":["baaa","ba+aa","baNaNa","baa+a"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The expression \'b\' + \'a\' + + \'a\' + \'a\' evaluates to \'baNaNa\'. Let\'s break it down: \'b\' + \'a\' concatenates to \'ba\'. Then, + \'a\' is the unary plus operator trying to convert \'a\' to a number, which results in NaN because \'a\' is not a valid numeric string. So, \'ba\' + NaN concatenates to \'baNaN\'. Finally, \'baNaN\' + \'a\' concatenates to \'baNaNa\'. This example demonstrates both string concatenation and JavaScript\'s type coercion behavior with the unary plus operator."},{"id":50,"question":"Which operator has the highest precedence in JavaScript?","options":["Assignment operators (=, +=)","Logical operators (&&, ||)","Arithmetical operators (+, -)","Grouping operator ()"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"The grouping operator () has the highest precedence in JavaScript. It can be used to override the default operator precedence, causing expressions within the parentheses to be evaluated first. For example, in 2 * (3 + 4), the addition 3 + 4 is evaluated first, then multiplied by 2, resulting in 14, not 10. Understanding operator precedence is crucial for writing correct expressions, but when in doubt, it\'s often clearer to use parentheses to explicitly specify the intended order of operations."}]}')},21514:function(e){"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"id":6,"title":"Template Literals","seoTitle":"JavaScript Template Literals Quiz - ES6 String Templates","description":"Test your knowledge of JavaScript template literals (template strings) with this comprehensive quiz.

This special syntax allows for features like multi-line strings and string interpolation, where variables and expressions can be embedded directly within the string using the ${} syntax. The use of backticks is what enables these advanced string capabilities, making template literals a powerful tool for creating dynamic and readable strings."},{"id":132,"question":"How do you include a JavaScript expression within a template literal?","options":["Using #{ expression }","Using ${ expression }","Using @{ expression }","Using %{ expression }"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"In JavaScript template literals, expressions are embedded using the syntax ${ expression }. When the template literal is evaluated, any expressions inside the ${} placeholders are executed, and their results are converted to strings and included in the final string value. This feature, called string interpolation, greatly simplifies string concatenation compared to older methods like using the + operator. For example, `Hello, ${name}!` will replace ${name} with the value of the name variable. The expression can be any valid JavaScript expression, including variables, function calls, arithmetic operations, or even nested template literals."},{"id":133,"question":"What is one advantage of template literals over traditional string concatenation in JavaScript?","options":["They execute faster","They use less memory","They can span multiple lines without special characters","They automatically escape HTML entities"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"One significant advantage of template literals is their ability to span multiple lines without needing special characters or concatenation. With regular strings, you would need to use escape sequences like \\\\n for line breaks or concatenate strings with the + operator. Template literals preserve the line breaks in the source code, making multi-line strings more readable and maintainable. For example, a multi-line HTML template can be written directly in the code without escaping newlines, which leads to cleaner, more readable code, especially for longer strings or when generating HTML content."},{"id":134,"question":"What happens when you try to use a variable in a template literal that is not defined?","options":["The template literal shows \'undefined\'","A ReferenceError is thrown","The template literal shows an empty string","The template literal shows \'null\'"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"When you try to use a variable in a template literal that is not defined, JavaScript throws a ReferenceError. This happens because the expressions inside ${} are evaluated as regular JavaScript code. In JavaScript, attempting to access an undeclared variable results in a ReferenceError, and this behavior applies equally within template literals. This error-checking behavior is actually beneficial as it helps catch typos or references to undefined variables earlier in the development process, rather than silently producing unexpected output like \'undefined\' or an empty string."},{"id":135,"question":"What is a \'tagged template\'?","options":["A template literal that includes HTML tags","A template literal that is marked with comments","A function that processes a template literal","A template literal that uses special syntax highlighting"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"A tagged template is a more advanced form of template literals where you prefix a template literal with a function name (the \'tag\'). This function receives the template\'s processed string parts and expressions as arguments, allowing you to customize how the template is processed and what is returned. The tag function\'s first argument is an array of string literals, and the remaining arguments are the evaluated values of the template\'s expressions. This powerful feature enables custom string parsing, sanitization, localization, styling (like with styled-components in React), and even building domain-specific languages. Unlike regular template literals that always result in strings, tagged templates can return any data type."},{"id":136,"question":"What will be the output of console.log(`The sum is ${2 + 3}`);?","options":["\\"The sum is ${2 + 3}\\"","\\"The sum is 2 + 3\\"","\\"The sum is 5\\"","Error"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The output will be \\"The sum is 5\\". In a template literal, the expressions inside ${} are evaluated before being inserted into the string. In this case, 2 + 3 evaluates to 5, so the value 5 is converted to a string and inserted into the template literal. This string interpolation feature of template literals makes it much easier to include dynamic values in strings compared to traditional string concatenation. The JavaScript engine executes the expression, converts the result to a string using its ToString algorithm, and then constructs the final string with the expression result inserted in place of the placeholder."},{"id":137,"question":"How do you include a backtick character within a template literal?","options":["By doubling it: ``","By escaping it with a backslash: \\\\`","By using a hex code: \\\\x60","By using ASCII code: &96;"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"To include a backtick character (`) within a template literal, you need to escape it with a backslash: \\\\`. Since backticks are used to denote the beginning and end of template literals, unescaped backticks inside a template literal would prematurely terminate the string. Escaping with a backslash tells JavaScript to treat the backtick as a literal character rather than as template literal syntax. This is similar to how you would escape quotes in regular strings, such as using \\\\\' inside a single-quoted string or \\\\\\" inside a double-quoted string. For example, `This is a template literal with a \\\\` backtick character` will result in \'This is a template literal with a ` backtick character\'."},{"id":138,"question":"What feature of template literals is particularly useful for generating HTML?","options":["Automatic HTML escaping","Built-in HTML validation","Multi-line support without escape sequences","Automatic indentation control"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Multi-line support without escape sequences is a feature of template literals that is particularly useful for generating HTML. When creating HTML strings in JavaScript, it\'s common to need multi-line strings to maintain readability. Before template literals, developers had to use concatenation or escape sequences (\\\\n) to create multi-line strings, which made the code harder to read and maintain. With template literals, you can write HTML-like content across multiple lines directly in your JavaScript, preserving the natural structure and indentation of the HTML. This makes the code much more readable and reduces the likelihood of syntax errors, especially for complex HTML structures."},{"id":139,"question":"Which ES version introduced template literals?","options":["ES5","ES6 (ES2015)","ES7 (ES2016)","ES8 (ES2017)"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Template literals were introduced in ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015. This version of JavaScript brought several major new features, including not only template literals but also arrow functions, classes, let/const declarations, destructuring, default parameters, and more. Template literals were part of this significant update to the language that made string manipulation more powerful and intuitive. The introduction of ES6 marked a significant evolution in JavaScript\'s capabilities, making the language more expressive and addressing many long-standing pain points, particularly around string handling and concatenation."},{"id":140,"question":"What happens to whitespace in template literals?","options":["All whitespace is automatically removed","All whitespace is preserved exactly as written","Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed","Only line breaks are preserved, other whitespace is normalized"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"In template literals, all whitespace is preserved exactly as written. This includes spaces, tabs, line breaks, and any other whitespace characters. This behavior differs from regular strings where multi-line support requires explicit line break characters (\\\\n). The preservation of whitespace can be both an advantage and a challenge. It\'s helpful when generating formatted text or code where spacing matters, but it may require additional handling when you want to control the whitespace, especially for HTML generation. Some developers use helper functions or tagged templates to manage whitespace when exact preservation isn\'t desired. Common techniques include using string methods like .trim() or creating custom tagged templates that normalize whitespace according to specific rules."},{"id":141,"question":"What is the appropriate name for string interpolation using ${} in template literals?","options":["String replacement","Expression embedding","Template interpolation","Variable substitution"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The formal term for using ${} syntax in template literals is \'expression embedding\' or more commonly \'template interpolation.\' This feature allows you to embed any valid JavaScript expression within a string using the ${expression} syntax. The expression is evaluated, and its result is converted to a string and inserted into the final string value. Template interpolation is more powerful than simple variable substitution because you can include not just variables but any valid JavaScript expression—function calls, arithmetic operations, ternary operators, and even other template literals. This enables more dynamic and concise string construction compared to traditional concatenation methods."},{"id":142,"question":"What is the result of `${\'a\' + \'b\'}` in JavaScript?","options":["${\'a\' + \'b\'}","${ab}","a + b","ab"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"The result of `${\'a\' + \'b\'}` is \'ab\'. Inside the ${} in a template literal, the expression \'a\' + \'b\' is evaluated first, resulting in the string \'ab\'. Then, this result is inserted into the template literal. The expression inside ${} can be any valid JavaScript expression, including string concatenation. In this case, the + operator performs string concatenation of \'a\' and \'b\' to create \'ab\'. Template literals evaluate all expressions inside ${} and convert the results to strings before constructing the final string output. This allows for powerful string composition where complex expressions can be embedded directly within string templates."},{"id":143,"question":"What happens if you use template literals with the \'new\' operator, like new `template`?","options":["It creates a new String object","It creates a template literal object","It throws a SyntaxError","It creates a RegExp object"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Using template literals with the \'new\' operator, like new `template`, will throw a SyntaxError. Template literals are not constructors and cannot be used with the \'new\' operator. They are a syntax for creating string primitives with special processing for interpolations and multi-line support. When JavaScript encounters a template literal, it processes it according to the template literal rules and produces a string primitive value. Since this is not a constructor function, attempting to use it with \'new\' is a syntax error. This is similar to how you cannot use string literals with \'new\', such as new \'string\', which would also result in a syntax error."},{"id":144,"question":"In a tagged template, what is the structure of the first argument passed to the tag function?","options":["A single concatenated string of all literals","An array of the string literals","A Map of string literals and their positions","A string literal followed by interpolated values"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"In a tagged template, the first argument passed to the tag function is an array of the string literals from the template. This array contains the string parts of the template, split at each ${} expression. If there are n expressions in the template, this array will contain n+1 strings (potentially empty strings if an expression appears at the beginning or end, or if two expressions are adjacent). This array also has a special property called \'raw\', which is another array containing the raw string literals before processing escape sequences. The remaining arguments to the tag function are the evaluated results of each interpolated expression in the order they appear. This structure gives the tag function complete access to both the static text and the dynamic values, allowing for sophisticated template processing."},{"id":145,"question":"What is the raw property available on the first argument of a tagged template function?","options":["The unprocessed template literal as a single string","An array of raw versions of the string literals without escape sequence processing","A boolean indicating if the template contains any raw HTML","A reference to the original template literal function"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The \'raw\' property available on the first argument of a tagged template function is an array of raw versions of the string literals without escape sequence processing. This means that escape sequences like \\\\n or \\\\t are not processed and are kept as the literal characters in the source code. This feature is useful when you need to access the exact characters as they appear in the source code, rather than their interpreted values. For example, if a template literal contains \'\\\\n\', the standard strings would have an actual newline character, but the raw versions would contain the two characters \'\\\\\' and \'n\'. The String.raw tag makes use of this property to create strings where escape sequences are treated as normal characters."},{"id":146,"question":"What does String.raw`` do in JavaScript?","options":["It returns the raw HTML representation of a template literal","It returns a template literal without processing escaped characters","It returns a byte array of the template literal","It returns a template literal with all special characters escaped"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"String.raw`` is a built-in tag function that returns a template literal without processing escape sequences. When you use String.raw with a template literal, escape sequences like \\\\n (newline), \\\\t (tab), or \\\\u00A9 (Unicode escape for \xa9) are not interpreted; instead, they are preserved as the literal characters in the source code. For example, String.raw`Line1\\\\nLine2` would result in the string \'Line1\\\\nLine2\' with the actual characters \'\\\\\' and \'n\', not a newline character. This is useful in situations where you want to create strings that contain backslashes that shouldn\'t be treated as escape sequences, such as when working with regular expressions, file paths on Windows, or when you need to display escape sequences in educational content."},{"id":147,"question":"How can you use template literals to create a multi-line string?","options":["By adding the \'multiline\' flag: `text`m","By using the \\\\n escape sequence within the backticks","Simply by including line breaks within the backticks","By using the multi-line method: `text`.multiline()"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"To create a multi-line string with template literals, you simply include line breaks within the backticks. Unlike traditional string literals using single or double quotes, template literals preserve line breaks exactly as they appear in the source code, without needing to use escape sequences like \\\\n. For example:\\n```javascript\\nconst multiLineString = `This is line one\\nThis is line two\\nThis is line three`;\\n```\\nThe resulting string will contain actual newline characters at the positions where the line breaks occur in the source code. This feature makes template literals particularly useful for writing HTML templates, SQL queries, or any other text that is more readable when formatted across multiple lines. The preserved line breaks are actual newline characters in the string value, not just visual formatting in the code."},{"id":148,"question":"What will be the output of: const name = \'World\'; console.log(`Hello \\\\${name}`);","options":["Hello World","Hello ${name}","Hello \\\\World","Error"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output will be \'Hello ${name}\'. When the $ symbol is escaped with a backslash (\\\\$) inside a template literal, it is treated as a literal dollar sign rather than the beginning of an interpolation expression. This means that the characters \'${name}\' are included as-is in the resulting string, and no variable substitution occurs. Escaping the dollar sign is useful when you want to include the literal text \'${something}\' in your output, such as when explaining template literal syntax in documentation or when generating code that itself contains template literals. This is similar to how you would escape quotes or backticks within their respective string types."},{"id":149,"question":"What is nested template interpolation?","options":["Using template literals inside regular strings","Using expressions inside template literals that themselves contain template literals","Using template literals inside HTML templates","Interpolating arrays and objects in template literals"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Nested template interpolation is the technique of using expressions inside template literals that themselves contain template literals. Since the ${} syntax can contain any valid JavaScript expression, it\'s perfectly valid to include another template literal within it. For example: ``The result is ${`${x} + ${y} = ${x + y}`}``. This nesting allows for powerful string composition where sub-templates can be conditionally included or modified before being incorporated into the main template. This technique is useful for complex string generation scenarios, such as when building HTML with dynamic parts that themselves contain dynamic content, or when implementing localization systems where placeholders might need further processing."},{"id":150,"question":"Which of the following is NOT a valid template literal usage?","options":["`Hello, ${name}!`","`The result is ${2 + 2}`","`Line 1\\nLine 2`","`${function() { return \'Dynamic\'; }}`"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"The invalid template literal usage is `${function() { return \'Dynamic\'; }}`. This is invalid because template interpolation requires an expression that evaluates to a value, but the code in the example just declares a function without calling it. The function declaration by itself doesn\'t return a value that can be converted to a string. To make this valid, you would need to immediately invoke the function: `${(function() { return \'Dynamic\'; })()}` or use an arrow function with implicit return: `${(() => \'Dynamic\')()}`. Alternatively, if the function is already defined elsewhere, you would simply call it: `${getDynamicText()}`. The other options are all valid template literal usages, demonstrating variable interpolation, expression evaluation, and multi-line strings."},{"id":151,"question":"What happens when you include an object in a template literal without explicit conversion?","options":["The object\'s properties are automatically listed","The object is serialized to JSON","The object\'s toString() method is called","A TypeError is thrown"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"When you include an object in a template literal without explicit conversion, the object\'s toString() method is called. For most objects, this returns \'[object Object]\' unless the toString() method has been overridden. This happens because when an expression is included in ${} within a template literal, JavaScript converts the result to a string. For objects, this conversion follows the same rules as string concatenation: it implicitly calls the object\'s toString() method. If you want a more useful representation of an object in a template literal, you\'ll typically need to explicitly convert it, such as using JSON.stringify(obj) to get a JSON representation, or accessing specific properties of the object, like `${obj.name}`."},{"id":152,"question":"How do tagged templates differ from regular template literals?","options":["Tagged templates can only contain string literals, not expressions","Tagged templates are processed by a function before producing a result","Tagged templates are only used in HTML contexts","Tagged templates execute faster than regular template literals"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Tagged templates differ from regular template literals in that they are processed by a function (the \'tag\') before producing a result. When you prefix a template literal with a function name, that function receives the template\'s string parts and interpolated expressions as arguments, giving you complete control over how the template is processed. This allows for powerful customizations such as creating DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages), implementing template safety features like automatic escaping of HTML, applying styling (as in the styled-components library for React), internationalization, and more. While regular template literals always evaluate to strings with interpolated values, tagged templates can return any value type, as determined by the tag function\'s implementation."},{"id":153,"question":"What is a common use case for tagged templates in modern JavaScript frameworks?","options":["Database query generation","CSS styling in component libraries","Form validation","Authentication"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"A common use case for tagged templates in modern JavaScript frameworks is CSS styling in component libraries. Libraries like styled-components, emotion, and lit-element use tagged templates to define CSS styles directly in JavaScript files. For example, in styled-components, you might write `const Button = styled.button`background: ${props => props.primary ? \'blue\' : \'white\'};`` to create a styled button component. The tagged template approach enables several powerful features: dynamic styling based on props, automatic scoping of styles to components, type checking with TypeScript, syntax highlighting with appropriate editor plugins, and the ability to extend and compose styles. This pattern has become a foundational technique in the CSS-in-JS ecosystem, allowing for more maintainable and component-centric styling approaches in modern web applications."},{"id":154,"question":"Can template literals call functions inside the ${} interpolation?","options":["No, only variables are allowed","Yes, but only if the functions don\'t have parameters","Yes, any valid JavaScript expression including function calls can be used","Yes, but only if the function returns a string"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Yes, template literals can call functions inside the ${} interpolation, and any valid JavaScript expression including function calls can be used. The expression inside ${} can be as simple as a variable reference or as complex as a function call with arguments, a ternary operation, an arithmetic calculation, or even an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression). For example, `Hello, ${getName()}!` or `Your total is ${calculateTotal(items, tax)}`. The expression is evaluated, and its result is converted to a string and inserted into the final string. This flexibility makes template literals extremely powerful for generating dynamic text. The function can return any type of value; it will be converted to a string as part of the template literal processing."},{"id":155,"question":"What is the output of `${null}${undefined}` in JavaScript?","options":["\\"\\"","\\"nullundefined\\"","\\"null undefined\\"","Error"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output of `${null}${undefined}` is \\"nullundefined\\". When null and undefined are used in template interpolation, they are converted to the strings \\"null\\" and \\"undefined\\" respectively. This follows JavaScript\'s general string conversion rules, where null becomes \\"null\\" and undefined becomes \\"undefined\\" when converted to strings. The template literal evaluates each interpolation separately and concatenates the results. Since there\'s no space or other characters between the two interpolations in this example, the strings are joined directly. This behavior is consistent with how these values are converted to strings in other contexts, such as with the String() function or when using the + operator with strings."},{"id":156,"question":"What happens if there\'s an error in an expression within a template literal?","options":["The expression is replaced with \'undefined\'","The expression is replaced with an error message","The error is caught and the template literal returns an empty string","The error propagates and can cause the script to terminate if not caught"],"correctAnswer":4,"explanation":"If there\'s an error in an expression within a template literal, the error propagates and can cause the script to terminate if not caught. Just like any other JavaScript expression, if an expression inside ${} throws an error (such as a ReferenceError for an undefined variable, or a TypeError for an invalid operation), that error will propagate up through the call stack. Template literals don\'t have any built-in error handling or suppression mechanisms. To handle potential errors in template literal expressions, you would need to use standard JavaScript error handling techniques like try/catch blocks around the template literal evaluation, or ensure that the expressions used are error-free, perhaps by using optional chaining (?.) or nullish coalescing (??) operators for potentially undefined values."},{"id":157,"question":"How would you implement a tag function that escapes HTML special characters in interpolated values?","options":["function html(strings, ...values) { /* implement later */ }","function escape`template` { /* implement later */ }","function html(strings, ...values) { return strings.reduce((result, str, i) => result + str + (values[i] ?

This function uses the tagged template pattern where the first parameter \'strings\' is an array of the string literals, and \'...values\' captures all interpolated values. The function then uses reduce() to reconstruct the template, but with HTML special characters in the interpolated values escaped. For each string part, it adds the string followed by the corresponding value (if it exists), after escaping characters like &, <, >, \\", and \' with their HTML entity numeric codes. This pattern is useful for preventing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks when inserting dynamic content into HTML.

Despite using the specialized template literal syntax with backticks, the result of evaluating a template literal is still a primitive string value. Template literals are a syntax for creating strings with enhanced features like interpolation and multi-line support, but the resulting value is a regular JavaScript string primitive. This means you can use all standard string methods on the result of a template literal, and it behaves exactly like strings created with single or double quotes in all contexts after the initial evaluation.

Before template literals, creating HTML strings in JavaScript was cumbersome, requiring concatenation or array joins with explicit line breaks. Template literals allow developers to write HTML-like content directly in JavaScript with preserved line breaks and indentation, making the code more maintainable and closer to the final output. This is particularly valuable for component-based UI frameworks. However, it\'s important to note that template literals don\'t automatically provide HTML sanitization (you\'d need a tagged template for that), don\'t validate HTML syntax, and don\'t perform any special optimizations for rendering.

Unlike simple string methods that would only see the final concatenated string, a tag function receives the static string parts as an array in its first parameter, and the evaluated expression results as subsequent parameters (or as an array with rest parameters). This separation gives tag functions complete information about the structure of the original template, allowing for sophisticated processing such as context-aware escaping, dynamic formatting based on both the static text and expression values, or even building entirely different data structures from the template. This can\'t be achieved with regular string methods because once a regular template literal is evaluated, the information about which parts were static and which were expressions is lost."}]}')},48451:function(e){"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"id":5,"title":"Truthy & Falsy Values","seoTitle":"JavaScript Truthy and Falsy Values Quiz","description":"Test your understanding of JavaScript\'s truth and falsehood concepts, truthiness evaluation in conditional statements, and how different values are implicitly converted to booleans in this in-depth quiz.","questions":[{"id":101,"question":"Which of the following is NOT a falsy value in JavaScript?","options":["0","\'\'","[]","null"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"An empty array ([]) is not a falsy value in JavaScript—it\'s truthy.

The logical OR returns the first truthy operand it encounters, or the last operand if all are falsy. This pattern is commonly used for setting default values in JavaScript, especially before the introduction of the nullish coalescing operator (??).

This is one of the very rare exceptions to JavaScript\'s truthy/falsy rules.

The String() function is used for explicit type conversion to string in JavaScript. It can convert any value to a string representation. For numbers, it simply returns the number as a string. For booleans, String(true) returns \'true\' and String(false) returns \'false\'. For null, it returns \'null\', and for undefined, it returns \'undefined\'.

The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer. It stops parsing when it encounters a character that is not a valid digit in the specified radix (base). In this case, the decimal point is not a valid digit, so parsing stops at that point, resulting in 123. This behavior makes parseInt() useful for extracting the integer portion of a number from a string. If the first character cannot be converted to a number, parseInt() returns NaN. Also note that parseInt(\'123abc\') would also return 123, ignoring the \'abc\' part."},{"id":87,"question":"What is the result of `1 == \'1\'` in JavaScript?","options":["true","false","1","Error"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The result of 1 == \'1\' is true. The == operator in JavaScript performs type coercion when comparing values of different types. In this case, the string \'1\' is converted to the number 1 before the comparison, and since 1 equals 1, the result is true. This is an example of implicit type coercion. To avoid type coercion and compare both value and type, you would use the strict equality operator (===), which would give false for 1 === \'1\' because the types are different."},{"id":88,"question":"What will `parseFloat(\'123.45abc\')` return?","options":["123","123.45","NaN","Error"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"parseFloat(\'123.45abc\') returns 123.45. The parseFloat() function parses a string and returns a floating-point number. Like parseInt(), it stops parsing when it encounters a character that cannot be part of a floating-point number. In this case, it parses \'123.45\' as the number 123.45 and ignores \'abc\'. Unlike parseInt(), parseFloat() recognizes decimal points and can return floating-point values.

The Number() function recognizes the \'0x\' prefix as indicating a hexadecimal number. In hexadecimal, \'10\' represents the decimal number 16 (1\xd716\xb9 + 0\xd716⁰). This is one of the special parsing rules for the Number() function. Similarly, Number(\'0b1010\') would return 10 (binary), and Number(\'0o10\') would return 8 (octal). This behavior differs from parseFloat(), which does not recognize these prefixes and would interpret \'0x10\' as just 0."},{"id":90,"question":"What will `+\'42\'` evaluate to in JavaScript?","options":["\'42\'","42","NaN","TypeError"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The expression +\'42\' evaluates to the number 42. The unary plus operator (+) attempts to convert its operand to a number. When applied to a string that contains a valid numeric representation, it converts the string to the corresponding number. This is a shorthand for Number(\'42\') and is an example of explicit type conversion, although it uses operator syntax rather than a function. The unary plus is often used as a concise way to convert strings to numbers."},{"id":91,"question":"What is the result of `[] + {}` in JavaScript?","options":["[]{}","[object Object]","0[object Object]","NaN"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The result of [] + {} is the string \'[object Object]\'. When the + operator is used with non-primitive types, JavaScript first converts them to primitives. An empty array [] converts to an empty string \'\', and an empty object {} converts to the string \'[object Object]\', which is the default string representation of a plain JavaScript object. So the expression becomes \'\' + \'[object Object]\', resulting in the string \'[object Object]\'. This demonstrates how the type coercion rules can lead to unexpected results when working with objects and arrays."},{"id":92,"question":"What will `!!0` evaluate to in JavaScript?","options":["0","true","false","undefined"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The expression !!0 evaluates to false. The ! operator (logical NOT) first converts its operand to a boolean and then negates it. The number 0 is falsy in JavaScript, so !0 evaluates to true (the negation of false). Then, !true evaluates to false. The double negation (!!) is a common idiom used to convert a value to its boolean equivalent, equivalent to Boolean(0). This technique is useful for explicitly converting values to booleans without changing their \'truthiness\'."},{"id":93,"question":"What is the result of `String(Symbol(\'foo\'))` in JavaScript?","options":["\'Symbol(foo)\'","\'foo\'","TypeError","Symbol(\'foo\')"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The result of String(Symbol(\'foo\')) is the string \'Symbol(foo)\'. Symbols are a primitive data type in JavaScript introduced in ES6, and they can be converted to strings explicitly using the String() function or the toString() method. However, it\'s important to note that symbols cannot be implicitly converted to strings, so an expression like Symbol(\'foo\') + \'\' would throw a TypeError. This is one of the ways Symbols differ from other primitive types in JavaScript and helps maintain their uniqueness."},{"id":94,"question":"What does `\'\' == false` evaluate to in JavaScript?","options":["true","false","undefined","TypeError"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The expression \'\' == false evaluates to true in JavaScript. When comparing a string and a boolean with the loose equality operator (==), JavaScript follows a specific conversion algorithm: first, the boolean is converted to a number (false becomes 0, true becomes 1), and then the string is converted to a number (an empty string becomes 0). Since 0 == 0 is true, the result is true. This is an example of why the loose equality operator can lead to confusing results and why many developers prefer the strict equality operator (===), which would return false for \'\' === false because the types are different."},{"id":95,"question":"What will `Number(undefined)` return?","options":["0","NaN","undefined","null"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Number(undefined) returns NaN (Not a Number). When the Number() function is used to convert undefined to a number, the result is NaN because undefined cannot be meaningfully represented as a number. This is different from Number(null), which returns 0. The behavior of NaN in calculations is special: any arithmetic operation involving NaN results in NaN, and NaN is not equal to any value, including itself (NaN !== NaN). The function isNaN() can be used to check if a value is NaN."},{"id":96,"question":"What is the result of `10 + +\'20\'` in JavaScript?","options":["\'1020\'","30","NaN","TypeError"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The result of 10 + +\'20\' is 30. The expression is evaluated as follows: first, the unary plus operator (+) is applied to the string \'20\', converting it to the number 20 (this is similar to Number(\'20\')). Then, the addition operator (+) adds 10 and 20, resulting in 30. This demonstrates how the unary plus can be used for explicit type conversion in an arithmetic context. Without the unary plus, the expression 10 + \'20\' would result in the string \'1020\' due to string concatenation."},{"id":97,"question":"What does `typeof NaN` return in JavaScript?","options":["\'undefined\'","\'object\'","\'number\'","\'NaN\'"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"typeof NaN returns \'number\'. Despite its name (Not a Number), NaN is actually a special value of the Number type in JavaScript. This might seem counterintuitive, but NaN is used to represent the result of numerical operations that cannot yield a meaningful result. For example, 0/0, Math.sqrt(-1), and parseInt(\'abc\') all result in NaN. To properly check if a value is NaN, you should use the isNaN() function or, more accurately, Number.isNaN() in modern JavaScript, since the global isNaN() first attempts to convert its argument to a number."},{"id":98,"question":"What will `parseInt(\'1010\', 2)` return?","options":["1010","12","10","NaN"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"parseInt(\'1010\', 2) returns 10. The second parameter to parseInt() specifies the radix (base) of the numeral system to be used. When the radix is 2, parseInt() interprets the string as a binary number. In binary, \'1010\' represents the decimal number 10 (1\xd72\xb3 + 0\xd72\xb2 + 1\xd72\xb9 + 0\xd72⁰). This functionality allows parseInt() to parse numbers in different numeral systems. Common bases include 2 (binary), 8 (octal), 10 (decimal), and 16 (hexadecimal). If the radix is not specified, it defaults to 10, except when the string starts with \'0x\' or \'0X\' (interpreted as hexadecimal)."},{"id":99,"question":"What is the result of `3 > 2 > 1` in JavaScript?","options":["true","false","1","Error"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The result of 3 > 2 > 1 is false. This is because comparison operators in JavaScript are left-associative, meaning they are evaluated from left to right. First, 3 > 2 is evaluated, which is true. Then, true > 1 is evaluated. In this comparison, true is implicitly converted to the number 1, so the comparison becomes 1 > 1, which is false. This counterintuitive result demonstrates the importance of understanding operator precedence and type coercion in JavaScript. To check if 3 is greater than 2 AND 2 is greater than 1, you would need to use the logical AND operator: (3 > 2) && (2 > 1)."},{"id":100,"question":"What does `{} + []` evaluate to in most JavaScript environments?","options":["0","[object Object]","[]","NaN"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"In most JavaScript environments, {} + [] evaluates to 0. This is a tricky case because the {} is interpreted as an empty code block (not an empty object) when it appears at the beginning of a statement. The expression is thus evaluated as +[], which converts the empty array to an empty string \'\', and then to the number 0. This behavior varies depending on context and environment. If you force the {} to be interpreted as an object by wrapping it in parentheses, ({} + []) would evaluate to \'[object Object]\', similar to [] + {}.

This is due to how floating-point numbers are represented in binary format. In JavaScript, numbers are implemented in double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. This format cannot exactly represent some decimal fractions, just as how 1/3 cannot be precisely represented in decimal. In this case, 0.1 + 0.2 actually equals to 0.30000000000000004, not exactly 0.3, resulting in the comparison returning false."},{"id":5,"question":"What is the difference between let and var in JavaScript?","options":["There is no difference","var has function scope, let has block scope","let has function scope, var has block scope","var is for constants, let is for variables"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The key difference is that \'var\' has function scope, while \'let\' has block scope. Variables declared with \'var\' are either function-scoped or globally-scoped, meaning they\'re visible throughout the function or global context. Variables declared with \'let\' are block-scoped, meaning they\'re only visible within the block (denoted by curly braces) in which they are declared. Additionally, \'var\' variables are hoisted and initialized with undefined, while \'let\' variables are hoisted but not initialized (resulting in a ReferenceError if accessed before declaration)."},{"id":6,"question":"Which data type is NOT mutable in JavaScript?","options":["Array","Object","String","Map"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Strings are immutable in JavaScript. This means that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string. For example, if you have a string \'hello\' and you do str[0] = \'H\', it will not change the original string.

The postfix increment operator (x++) returns the value of x before incrementing it. This means that the expression \'x = x++\' first gets the current value of x (which is 5), then increments x to 6, but then assigns the previously retrieved value (5) back to x. This is why x ends up as 5, not 6. To achieve the increment and assignment, you should use either \'x = x + 1\', \'x += 1\', or the prefix increment \'x = ++x\'."},{"id":8,"question":"Which of the following is true about the Symbol data type in JavaScript?","options":["Symbols are just strings with special properties","Every Symbol() call creates a unique value","Symbols are primarily used for DOM manipulation","Symbols can be created using the \'new\' keyword"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Every Symbol() call creates a unique value. Symbols were introduced in ES6 as a new primitive data type. The main purpose of Symbols is to provide unique identifiers that won\'t collide with other property names, making them useful for adding properties to objects without the risk of name collisions. Symbols are not strings, they cannot be created with the \'new\' keyword (Symbol is not a constructor), and they are not specifically related to DOM manipulation."},{"id":9,"question":"What is the result of: typeof undefined;","options":["undefined","null","object","string"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"The result of typeof undefined is the string \'undefined\'. In JavaScript, typeof is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. For the value undefined, it correctly returns the string \'undefined\'. This is one of the consistent behaviors of the typeof operator, unlike typeof null which returns \'object\' due to a historical bug."},{"id":10,"question":"In JavaScript, which of the following is a valid way to check if a variable is an array?","options":["typeof arr === \'array\'","arr instanceof Array","arr.type === Array","arr.isArray()"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The correct way to check if a variable is an array is using \'arr instanceof Array\' or the more recommended \'Array.isArray(arr)\'. The typeof operator returns \'object\' for arrays, not \'array\', so typeof arr === \'array\' would be false. There is no .type property on arrays, and isArray() is a static method on the Array constructor, not a method on array instances, so arr.isArray() would result in an error."},{"id":11,"question":"What does the following code return? Boolean(0);","options":["true","false","0","NaN"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Boolean(0) returns false. The Boolean() function converts its argument to a boolean value according to the following rules: The values 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, and the empty string (\'\') all convert to false. Everything else, including objects and arrays (even empty ones), converts to true. This process is known as \'type coercion\' or \'type conversion\'."},{"id":12,"question":"What is the value of myVar after this code? let myVar;","options":["null","undefined","\'\'","0"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The value of myVar will be undefined. In JavaScript, when you declare a variable without initializing it, it automatically gets the value undefined. This is different from null, which is an explicit value representing the intentional absence of any object value.

The curly braces {} notation is object literal syntax for creating an empty object. In contrast, let obj = []; creates an empty array, let obj = \'\'; creates an empty string, and let obj = null; assigns the null value to the variable, not an empty object."},{"id":14,"question":"What is the value of typeof NaN?","options":["undefined","number","NaN","object"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The value of typeof NaN is \'number\'. This might seem counterintuitive, but in JavaScript, NaN (Not a Number) is actually a special value of the Number type.

This means you can use variables and functions before they are declared in your code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations. For variables declared with var, they are initialized with undefined when hoisted, but variables declared with let and const are hoisted without initialization (resulting in a ReferenceError if accessed before declaration). Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning both the declaration and definition are moved to the top."},{"id":18,"question":"What will be output by this code? console.log(1 + true);","options":["1true","true1","2","error"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The output will be 2. In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a number and a boolean, the boolean is converted to a number (true becomes 1, false becomes 0), and then addition is performed.

BigInt was introduced in ES2020 to handle integers of arbitrary length, addressing the limitation of the Number type which can only safely represent integers between -(2^53 - 1) and (2^53 - 1). BigInt literals are created by appending \'n\' to the end of an integer (e.g., 9007199254740992n) or by using the BigInt() function. BigInt is a separate primitive type from Number, and you cannot mix BigInt and Number in arithmetic operations without explicit conversion. It is not specifically related to dates and times."},{"id":20,"question":"What is the result of typeof [1, 2, 3]; in JavaScript?","options":["array","object","list","collection"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The result of typeof [1, 2, 3]; is \'object\'. In JavaScript, arrays are technically objects with special behaviors and methods. This is why the typeof operator returns \'object\' for arrays, which can sometimes be confusing. To specifically identify if a value is an array, you should use Array.isArray([1, 2, 3]), which would return true.

For example, if you have let x; and then try to access x.property, JavaScript will throw: \'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading \'property\')\'. This occurs because undefined is a primitive value, not an object, and therefore doesn\'t have properties. A ReferenceError would occur if you tried to access a variable that hasn\'t been declared at all (e.g., console.log(y) without declaring y)."},{"id":22,"question":"What is the value of x after running this code? let x = \'5\'; x = +x + 1;","options":["\'51\'","6","\'6\'","NaN"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The value of x will be 6. The unary plus operator (+) before a variable converts it to a number if it\'s not already one. So +x converts the string \'5\' to the number 5. Then, 5 + 1 evaluates to 6, which is assigned back to x. This is different from let x = \'5\'; x = x + 1;, which would result in the string \'51\' due to string concatenation when the + operator is used with a string and a number."},{"id":23,"question":"Which statement about const in JavaScript is false?","options":["const variables cannot be reassigned","const objects cannot have their properties modified","const arrays cannot have elements added or removed","const must be initialized during declaration"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The false statement is that \'const objects cannot have their properties modified\'. While const prevents reassignment of the variable itself, it doesn\'t make the value immutable. If the value is an object or array, its properties or elements can still be modified, added, or removed. For example, with const obj = {name: \'John\'};, you cannot do obj = {name: \'Jane\'};, but you can do obj.name = \'Jane\';. The same applies to arrays: you can modify their elements but cannot reassign the variable to a new array."},{"id":24,"question":"What is the output of this code? console.log(typeof typeof 1);","options":["number","string","undefined","syntax error"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The output is \'string\'. The typeof operator always returns a string representing the data type of its operand. In this case, typeof 1 evaluates to the string \'number\'. Then, typeof \'number\' evaluates to \'string\', because \'number\' is a string value. This nested usage of typeof demonstrates that typeof always returns a string value, regardless of the operand\'s type."},{"id":25,"question":"What happens when you assign a value to an undeclared variable in JavaScript?","options":["It creates a local variable","It creates a global variable (in non-strict mode)","It throws a ReferenceError","It creates a variable with block scope"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"In non-strict mode, assigning a value to an undeclared variable creates a global variable. For example, if you write x = 10; without previously declaring x with var, let, or const, JavaScript will create x as a property of the global object (window in browsers). However, this behavior is considered bad practice and can lead to unexpected bugs.

only with Object.defineProperty","Accessors always require writable: true"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"This code demonstrates that property accessors (getters/setters) can control how values are processed: 1) The setter parses the full name into first and last names, 2) It stores these components in separate internal properties (_firstName, _lastName), 3) The getter reconstructs the full name from these components, 4) This provides a clean interface while maintaining internal data structure, 5) Accessors enable computed properties that transform or validate data on access, 6) They can maintain internal state that\'s updated when the property is modified, 7) This pattern is powerful for creating properties that have derived or processed values."},{"id":830,"question":"When using

descriptors, 2) Accessor properties use \'get\' and/or \'set\' functions, 3) Data properties directly store values, while accessor properties compute values on-demand, 4) You cannot mix them - a property must be either data or accessor, not both, 5) Both types can be enumerable and configurable, 6) Accessor properties are computed each time they\'re accessed, 7) Accessor properties are ideal

You can only change writable from true to false as a one-way operation, 3) Attempting to change enumerable or any other attribute will fail, 4) The second defineProperty call works because it\'s only changing writable from true to false, 5) The third call fails because it\'s trying to change enumerable on a non-configurable property, 6) This restriction ensures that once a property is locked down

\'Name too short\' because: 1) The first assignment user.name = \'John\' passes validation and is stored, 2) The getter returns the stored value when console.log(user.name) is called, 3) The second assignment user.name = \'Jo\' triggers validation in the setter, 4) Since \'Jo\' is less than 3 characters, the setter throws an error, 5) The catch block catches this error and logs its message, 6) This demonstrates how accessor properties can perform validation to enforce business rules, 7) The internal _name property stores the actual data while the accessors provide a controlled

successfully changed, 4) The attempt to add a new top-level property failed silently, resulting in undefined, 5) This demonstrates the limitation of Object.freeze() with nested objects, 6) For deep

with privileged method pattern: 1) The \'name\' parameter is captured in a closure, making it private to the instance, 2) The property accessor (getter) provides read-only access to this private data, 3) No setter is defined, making the property effectively read-only, 4) The property is enumerable, so it appears in iterations and Object.keys(), 5) External code cannot modify the name directly, but internal methods could, 6) This creates true private state in JavaScript before class private fields were available, 7) This pattern leverages closures and property descriptors to achieve

modifying the internal observers array","It\'s a JavaScript requirement for arrays"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"The \'observers\' property is defined with a getter that returns a copy to prevent external code from modifying the internal observers array: 1) It returns a new array with [...observers] to create a defensive copy, 2) This prevents external code from directly adding, removing, or reordering observers, 3) It maintains encapsulation by controlling access to the internal state, 4) Changes to the array must go through the public API (addObserver), 5) This ensures the Observable maintains control over its observer list, 6) It\'s a common pattern for protecting internal collections while still providing read access, 7) Without this protection, external code could interfere with the observer notification mechanism."},{"id":839,"question":"What method can check if an object is

It returns true if the object is frozen, false otherwise, 2) An object is considered frozen when all its properties are non-configurable and non-writable, and no new properties can be added, 3) It returns true for objects that have been passed to Object.freeze(), 4) Empty objects that are non-extensible are also considered frozen, 5) It\'s part of a family of testing methods including Object.isSealed() and Object.isExtensible(), 6) These methods are useful for defensive programming and feature detection, 7) They help determine the current state of an object before attempting

asynchronous"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() returns a single property descriptor, while Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors() returns all descriptors: 1) getOwnPropertyDescriptor() accepts an object and a property name, returning that specific descriptor, 2) getOwnPropertyDescriptors() accepts an object and returns an object containing all property descriptors, 3) The plural version is more efficient when you need to examine multiple properties, 4) It\'s particularly useful for cloning objects with all their property attributes, 5) The return

object, 2) It then uses defineProperties() to apply these exact descriptors to a new object, 3) This correctly clones accessor properties with their getters and setters, 4) The clone maintains the same property behavior but with independent state, 5) This approach preserves all property attributes (enumerable, configurable, etc.), 6) It\'s superior to Object.assign() which doesn\'t preserve

setting the object\'s prototype (Object.prototype in this case), 2) It allows defining properties with complete descriptors during object creation, 3) It eliminates the need for separate Object.defineProperties() calls, 4) It creates a clean, declarative way to fully specify an object\'s structure, 5) All properties have precisely controlled behaviors from creation, 6) This pattern is

trap, 2) The default behavior forwards to the target object, potentially freezing it, 3) Custom preventExtensions traps might implement different behaviors, 4) Some combinations of traps and target object modifications can cause TypeError, 5) A proxy with a revocable reference can\'t be frozen after revocation, 6) This is one of the more complex interactions in JavaScript\'s object system, 7) Generally, it\'s clearer to freeze the target object directly rather than through a proxy."},{"id":844,"code":"const user = {};\\n\\nObject.defineProperty(user, \'name\', {\\n  value: \'John\',\\n

non-writable but configurable property?","options":["\'John\'","\'Jane\'","undefined","Error will be thrown"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The console will log \'Jane\' because: 1) The initial property is defined as non-writable (writable: false), 2) However, it is also defined as configurable (configurable: true), 3) When a property is configurable, its entire descriptor can be redefined, 4) The second defineProperty() call redefines the property with a new value, 5) This bypasses the writable restriction through complete redefinition, 6) This demonstrates that configurability supersedes writability in terms of allowing value changes, 7) This behavior highlights why making truly immutable properties requires both writable: false and configurable: false."},{"id":845,"code":"const settings = { darkMode: false };\\n\\nObject.defineProperty(settings, \'theme\', {\\n  get() {\\n    return this.darkMode ? \'dark\' : \'light\';\\n  },\\n  enumerable:

changes?","options":["\'light\', \'light\'","\'light\', \'dark\'","\'dark\', \'light\'","\'dark\', \'dark\'"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The console will log \'light\' then \'dark\' because: 1) The \'theme\' property is a getter that computes its value based on the darkMode property, 2) Initially darkMode is false, so the first call returns \'light\', 3) After changing darkMode to true, the getter recalculates and returns \'dark\', 4) This demonstrates how accessor properties can create computed/derived values, 5) The property dynamically reflects the current state without needing explicit updates, 6) This pattern is useful for values that depend on other properties, 7) It maintains the DRY principle by computing values rather than duplicating state."},{"id":846,"question":"What is a symbol property and how does it relate to property descriptors?","options":["Symbol properties can\'t have descriptors","Symbol properties always have configurable: false","Symbol properties are like string properties but with unique keys and normal descriptors","Symbol properties can only be accessors, not data properties"],"correctAnswer":3,"explanation":"Symbol properties are like string properties but with unique keys and normal descriptors: 1) They use Symbol values instead of strings as property keys, 2) They can have the same property descriptors (writable, enumerable, configurable) as string properties, 3) They can be defined and modified with Object.defineProperty(), 4) They can be data properties or accessor properties, 5) They aren\'t enumerated by for...in loops or Object.keys() (but are visible to Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()), 6) They\'re useful for adding properties that

20","25, 77 then 68","25, 77 then 77"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"The console will log \'25, 77\' then \'20\' because: 1) Initially celsius is 25, so fahrenheit is 25 * 9/5 + 32 = 77, 2) Setting fahrenheit to 68 triggers its setter, which converts to celsius as (68 - 32) * 5/9 = 20, 3) The internal celsius variable is updated to 20, 4) The final log shows this updated celsius value, 5) This

library, 2) Public properties (version, calculate) are made enumerable for discoverability, 3) Internal utilities (_helpers) are non-enumerable to hide them from normal enumeration, 4) All properties are non-writable to prevent modification, 5) The use of property descriptors provides fine-grained control over the interface, 6) This pattern is common in JavaScript libraries that need to expose a

with the own property name (\'World\'), 2) The attempt to change greeting fails silently (in non-strict mode) because it\'s defined as non-writable on the prototype, 3) The second log still uses the original greeting value, 4) This demonstrates how property descriptors on prototype properties affect derived objects, 5) Own properties can shadow prototype properties, but can\'t modify them, 6)
